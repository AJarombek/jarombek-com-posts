Since I graduated from college almost six years ago, I’ve maintained a website, <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">
saintsxctf.com</a>, for my former collegiate cross country and track & field teams.  The website has evolved over
the years, as I’ve explained in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">prior
articles</a>, but at its core it has a client facing mobile app and website, backend APIs, and a database.  The
main API, written in Python using the Flask framework, has been in service for almost two years now.
</p>
<p>
During the Flask APIs initial development, I wrote many integration tests, asserting that certain API calls
returned appropriate responses.  I wrote an article about <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-10-2022-flask-api-testing">
these tests and how they were configured</a>.  My initial API testing approach was flawed in two ways.  First, it was
dependent on production data to properly function.  Second, it could only be run locally.
</p>
<p>
Using GitHub Actions and Docker containers, I configured Flask API integration tests as part of my CI/CD pipeline.
In this article, I’ll give an overview of my application infrastructure and show how GitHub Actions are leveraged to
run integration tests and code quality tests every time I commit new code.

My Flask API is part of a larger "SaintsXCTF" application that is hosted on AWS.  The following image shows my
application's infrastructure, with the Flask API outlined in red.

The Flask API is a REST API supporting basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).  A basic request to get a
list of endpoints related to users in the API is shown below.

<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl https://api.saintsxctf.com/v2/users/links

<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
   "endpoints":[
      {
         "description":"Get all the users in the database.",
         "link":"/v2/users",
         "verb":"GET"
      },
      {
         "description":"Create a new user.",
         "link":"/v2/users",
         "verb":"POST"

      {
         "description":"Retrieve a single user with a given username.",
         "link":"/v2/users/&lt;username>",
         "verb":"GET"
      },
      {
         "description":"Update a user with a given username.",
         "link":"/v2/users/&lt;username>",
         "verb":"PUT"
      },
      {

         "link":"/v2/users/soft/&lt;username>",
         "verb":"DELETE"
      },
      ...

<Definition word="Flask">
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs.
It provides an API for handling requests and responses, and allows developers to define routes and views using Python
functions. Flask is often used for building small to medium-sized web applications and APIs, and can be easily extended
with a wide range of third-party libraries and packages.
</Definition>
<p>
To integrate Flask API tests and code quality checks into my CI/CD pipeline, technologies such as GitHub Actions,
Docker, Pylint, and Black are utilized.
</p>
<Definition word="GitHub Actions">
GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows users to automate their CI/CD workflows by creating custom
scripts, called "Actions," that can be triggered by specific events on the platform, such as a push to a repository or
the opening of a pull request. These actions perform tasks such as building and testing code, deploying software, and
running automated checks.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Docker">
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are a lightweight and
portable form of virtualization that allow developers to package an application and its dependencies together in a
single container, making it easy to deploy and run on any system.  Docker is widely used in software development,
providing a consistent and efficient way to package and deploy applications. It is platform-agnostic and supports
multiple operating systems, which enables developers to build and run applications on different environments and
infrastructures.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Pylint">
Pylint is a source code quality checker for the Python programming language. It checks code for adherence to a certain
standard, as well as for errors and potential issues. Pylint can be used to check for a wide range of coding issues,
including coding style, naming conventions, and potential bugs. It also has the ability to generate reports, including
a detailed list of issues found in the code, and provides suggestions to fix the issues.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Black">
Black is a popular code formatter for the Python programming language. It is a command-line tool that automatically
reformats Python code according to a set of predefined rules and conventions. Black uses a strict, uncompromising
approach to formatting, which results in clean and consistent code that is easy to read and maintain. It helps to
reduce the time spent on code formatting and allows developers to focus on the logic of the code. Black is highly
configurable and can be set up to work with different coding conventions and styles.
</Definition>
<p>
I use Docker to package components of my application into separate containers.  For example, I have a container for my
Flask API, MySQL database (used for testing and local development purposes only), web application, and more.  Some of these
containers are used by GitHub Actions workflows to perform integration tests and code quality checks.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="GitHub Actions Workflows">GitHub Actions Workflows</SectionTitle>
<p>
My Flask API contains two GitHub Actions workflows - one for linting and formatting Python code and another for API
integration tests.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="1-31-23-github-workflows.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">

<SubTitle title="Lint and Format Workflow">Lint and Format Workflow</SubTitle>
<p>
The linting and formatting workflow is less intricate than the integration test workflow, so I will discuss it first.
In my API, Python code is linted using Pylint and formatted using Black.  When working locally, using Pylint and Black
is as simple as the following two commands (run within my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/tree/v2.0.3/api/src">api/src directory</a>).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Pylint Linting
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')

# Black Formatting
black .

Iâ€™ve worked with Databricks for two years at my full-time job, building ETLs and workflows using Spark and Delta Lake.
The Databricks data lakehouse is a powerful platform, supporting diverse data workloads in the cloud with simple Spark
and SQL programming techniques.  Recently, I created my own Databricks infrastructure in my AWS account, allowing me to
work with Databricks for personal applications and experimentation purposes.  This article demonstrates how to quickly
set up a Databricks workspace on AWS using Terraform.  The code for this article is available in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/databricks-spark-programs">databricks-spark-programs</a> repository on GitHub.

A prerequisite for building Databricks infrastructure on AWS is an AWS account, a Databricks account, and a local
development environment with Terraform installed<sup>1</sup>.

The Databricks infrastructure, provisioned using Terraform, builds a workspace. A workspace is a cloud environment for
the Databricks data lakehouse<sup>2</sup>.  At a high level, a Databricks workspace consists of a control plane and a
data plane.  The control place is hosted by Databricks, and mainly consists of a web application to interact with the
Databricks workspace.  The data plane exists in a tenant's AWS account, and mainly consists of clusters running Apache
Spark.  The control plane "controls" the clusters within the data plane, scaling them up and down, running Spark jobs,
etc<sup>3</sup>.

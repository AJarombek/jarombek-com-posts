Lately I've read about graph databases and their place in the NoSQL data storage
universe. The graph database I've worked with is Neo4j, which is fun and easy to get started with.
I found the user interface very enjoyable for viewing graphs and executing queries.
I highly recommend it if you need a graph database solution.
</p>
<p>
Graph databases largest draw is related data storage and the speed at which you can query related data points (or in
graph terms, nodes/vertices). Relationships are first class citizens, which allows
related data queries to be executed by traversing relationships themselves.  This is contrasted
with a typical relational database where you have to find relationships through
foreign keys or combine two tables with a very slow SQL <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
JOIN</code> operation<sup>1</sup>. The same slow query in a RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management
System) is extremely quick in a graph database.
</p>
<p>
One of the first graphs I made in Neo4j represented the county I grew up in -
<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/32/10/06/3210060e2e11b84a497e7b56dac7fbb8--connecticut-ancestry.jpg">
Fairfield County CT</a>.  My first task was to create a vertex representing a state - in
this case Connecticut.  In Cypher (the query language used by Neo4j) that was easy!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Cypher">
CREATE (ct:State {name: 'Connecticut'}) RETURN ct
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CREATE</code> statement builds a vertex and passes it a label
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">:State</code> and a property <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>
. The label is used for grouping - in this case all states will have the label
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">:State</code>. Properties can give vertices names along
with supplying additional key-&gt;value information.
</p>
<p>
Building multiple vertices at once can be done from a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CREATE</code>
 statement. I utilize this to populate the counties towns and cities:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Cypher">
CREATE (:City {name: 'Bridgeport'}),
  (:City {name: 'Danbury'}),
  ...

CREATE (:Town {name: 'Bethel'}),
  (:Town {name: 'Brookfield'}),
  ...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Before I made any relationships, I wanted to simplify things and group together cities and
towns under one common label. After all towns and cities are both considered settlements.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Cypher">
MATCH (s) WHERE s:City OR s:Town SET s:Settlement
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I introduced some new keywords here, most importantly <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MATCH</code>,
 which queries the database based on some ASCII Art I pass it. The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">(s)</code> token represents a node in the database that I assign
to variable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">s</code>. This query can be read as "for each vertex in the database
that is a city or town, give the vertex a new label called Settlement". In Neo4j vertices can have multiple labels, so the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SET</code> operation will not override old labels.
</p>
<p>
Now its time for the fun part: relationships. Lets create a relationship between all the
settlements and the state of Connecticut:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Cypher">
MATCH (ct:State), (s:Settlement) MERGE (ct)<-[:IN]-(s)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As you likely guessed, the ASCII art for relationships is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;-[:IN]-</code>
where the arrow shows the direction of the relationship. Relationships are given a
label, in this case <code className="jarombek-inline-code">:IN</code>
.  Relationships can also have properties just like a vertex. This is what I
meant by 'relationships are first class entities' - they are treated and queried just
like a vertex! First class relationships are extremely powerful.
</p>
<p>
You may have noticed the query matches multiple vertices. I looked for
all vertices where the label is State or Settlement. Then I created the
relationship "all settlements are in all the states". Since the only state in the database is
Connecticut, all settlements are given an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">:IN</code> relationship
to Connecticut.
</p>
<p>
For the final step I created relationships between all the
neighboring towns. The query is long so I'll just show a snippet (the full code
for all queries is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/
master/2017/11-Nov/11-6-Neo4j-Create/neo4j-create.cql">GitHub</a>):
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Cypher">
MATCH (greenwich:Settlement {name: 'Greenwich'}),
  (stamford:Settlement {name: 'Stamford'}),
  (newcannan:Settlement {name: 'New Cannan'}),
  (darien:Settlement {name: 'Darien'}),
  ...
CREATE (greenwich)-[:NEIGHBORS_OF]->(stamford),
  (stamford)-[:NEIGHBORS_OF]->(newcannan),
  (stamford)-[:NEIGHBORS_OF]->(darien),
  ...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code creates neighbor relationships between towns that share borders. One thing
that I questioned when writing this code is 'why cant there be bi-directional
relationships?' It turns out Neo4j does not support
bi-directional relationships at this time. This is because traversing a relationship takes the same
amount of time (O(1)) regardless of the direction it is pointing<sup>2</sup>. In a case like
this where the relationships should be bi-directional, you can
just ignore the arrow in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MATCH</code>
queries. Below you can see the output of the settlements in the Neo4j user interface:

I will look further at Neo4j and build off this graph in future discoveries. I hope this post
helps show how simple it is to build a graph database!

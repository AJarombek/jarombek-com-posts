For more complex queries and data manipulation in MongoDB, we can use the aggregation framework.
First introduced in MongoDB V2.2 (the current version as of this writing is V3.6) the aggregation
framework creates a pipeline of operations to perform on documents<sup>1</sup>.  Inside the pipeline
we can do operations such as sorting, filtering, and grouping documents similar to a SQL
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">GROUP BY</code> clause.  You can even manipulate grouped data
inside the pipeline, creating entirely new collections in the process.  Lets use our tree database used in the
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">first</a> and
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-16-2017-mongodb-pt2">second</a>
MongoDB discoveries to explore this framework.

<p>
If you remember each tree has a type and a grade specifying the height of the tree.  Let's say we
wanted to find the total number of trees in each grade with type frazier fir.  The aggregation function
would be like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$match: {type: 'frazier'}},
    {$group: {
        _id: '$grade',
        count: {$sum:1}
    }},
    {$sort: {count: -1}}
])

/* Result */
{ "_id" : "9-10ft", "count" : 71 }
{ "_id" : "10+ft", "count" : 70 }
{ "_id" : "6-7ft", "count" : 68 }
{ "_id" : "7-8ft", "count" : 67 }
{ "_id" : "5-6ft", "count" : 63 }
{ "_id" : "3-4ft", "count" : 61 }
{ "_id" : "8-9ft", "count" : 61 }
{ "_id" : "4-5ft", "count" : 58 }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see that the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">aggregate()</code> function takes an array
of pipeline steps.  So we first match on type frazier, group by the grade and get a count of documents
in that group, and finally sort by the count.  These three steps are performed with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$match</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$group</code>,
and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$sort</code> operators respectively.
</p>
<p>
You can also group on more than one property by adding it to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
_id</code> object.  In the next example we group on both type and grade.  Also since we are matching
on the entire collection, we can exclude the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$match</code> step
from the pipeline.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: {type: '$type', grade: '$grade'},
        count: {$sum:1}
    }},
    {$sort: {count: -1}}
])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can also combine multiple <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$group</code> operations in an
aggregation pipeline.  In the next pipeline we are going to get all the tree statistics - count,
expenses, revenue, and profits.  Since we don't want the result of this aggregation to go to waste,
we are going to save its result to a collection with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$out</code>
operator.  We just need to specify the name of the collection to save to, in this case
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">treestat</code>.  We also use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
$project</code> operator to structure and pick the properties that we want in the collection.  All
properties specified in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$project</code> step are passed to the
next step in the pipeline.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: {
            type: '$type',
            grade: '$grade',
            source: '$source_price',
            sell: '$sell_price'
        },
        count: {$sum:1},
        expenses: {$sum: '$source_price'},
        revenue: {$sum: '$sell_price'}
    }},
    {$group: {
        _id: {
            type: '$_id.type',
            grade: '$_id.grade',
            source: '$_id.source',
            sell: '$_id.sell',
            count: '$count',
            expenses: '$expenses',
            revenue: '$revenue'
        },
        profit: {$sum: {$subtract: ['$revenue', '$expenses']}}
    }},
    {$sort: {profit: -1}},
    {$project: {
        _id: {
            type: '$_id.type',
            grade: '$_id.grade'
        },
        count: '$_id.count',
        expenses: '$_id.expenses',
        revenue: '$_id.revenue',
        profit: '$profit'
    }},
    {$out: 'treestat'}
])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One important thing to note about the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$out</code> operator is that
it completely replaces the existing collection with the result of our aggregation<sup>2</sup>.  This
means that you could accidentally wipe out an entire collection such as
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">tree</code>. Then our database would be ruined!
</p>
<p>
Let's now get the tree count, expenses, revenue, and profits for all trees using our newly created tree
stat collection:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.treestat.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: 'all_trees',
        total_trees: {$sum: '$count'},
        total_expenses: {$sum: '$expenses'},
        total_revenue: {$sum: '$revenue'},
        total_profit: {$sum: '$profit'}
    }}
])

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : "all_trees",
    "total_trees" : 1001,
    "total_expenses" : 10220.5,
    "total_revenue" : 62245,
    "total_profit" : 52024.5
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Hopefully this has begun to show the power of the aggregation framework.  You can even use the framework
to create a kind of pseudo <code class="jarombek-inline-code">JOIN</code>
operation between collections<sup>3</sup>!  You can find the source code for this discovery

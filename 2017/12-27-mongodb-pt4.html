For more complex queries and data manipulation in MongoDB, we can use the aggregation framework.
First introduced in MongoDB V2.2 (the current version as of this writing is V3.6) the aggregation
framework creates a pipeline of operations to perform on documents<sup>1</sup>.  Pipelines
support operations such as sorting, filtering, and grouping documents similar to a SQL
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">GROUP BY</code> clause.  Pipelines also enable grouped data manipulation,
creating entirely new collections in the process.  I used the tree database from my
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">first</a> and
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-16-2017-mongodb-pt2">second</a>
MongoDB discoveries to explore the aggregation framework.
</p>

If you remember from my previous posts, each tree has a type and a grade which specifies the height of the tree.  One piece of
information I'm curious about is the total number of trees in each grade with type frazier fir.  The aggregation function
to answer my question is written like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$match: {type: 'frazier'}},
    {$group: {
        _id: '$grade',
        count: {$sum:1}
    }},
    {$sort: {count: -1}}
])

/* Result */
{ "_id" : "9-10ft", "count" : 71 }
{ "_id" : "10+ft", "count" : 70 }
{ "_id" : "6-7ft", "count" : 68 }
{ "_id" : "7-8ft", "count" : 67 }
{ "_id" : "5-6ft", "count" : 63 }
{ "_id" : "3-4ft", "count" : 61 }
{ "_id" : "8-9ft", "count" : 61 }
{ "_id" : "4-5ft", "count" : 58 }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">aggregate()</code> function takes an array
of pipeline steps.  The first step matches on type frazier.  The seconds step groups all matched documents by grade and gets the number of documents
in each group. The final step sorts each group by the count.  These three steps are performed with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$match</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$group</code>,
and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$sort</code> operators respectively.
</p>
<p>
Grouping is not restricted to a single property.  To group by multiple properties, each property is added to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
_id</code> object.  In the next example I grouped the aggregate by type and grade.  Also since I matched
on the entire collection, I excluded the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$match</code> pipeline step.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: {type: '$type', grade: '$grade'},
        count: {$sum:1}
    }},
    {$sort: {count: -1}}
])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Multiple <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$group</code> operations can exist in an
aggregation pipeline.  In the next pipeline I get all the tree statistics - count,
expenses, revenue, and profits.  Since I don't want the result of this aggregation to go to waste,
I saved its result to a new collection with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$out</code>
operator.  I simply specified the name of the collection to save the output to
(<code class="jarombek-inline-code">treestat</code>).  I also used the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
$project</code> operator to structure and pick the properties for the output collection.  All
properties specified in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$project</code> step are passed to the
next step in the pipeline.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: {
            type: '$type',
            grade: '$grade',
            source: '$source_price',
            sell: '$sell_price'
        },
        count: {$sum:1},
        expenses: {$sum: '$source_price'},
        revenue: {$sum: '$sell_price'}
    }},
    {$group: {
        _id: {
            type: '$_id.type',
            grade: '$_id.grade',
            source: '$_id.source',
            sell: '$_id.sell',
            count: '$count',
            expenses: '$expenses',
            revenue: '$revenue'
        },
        profit: {$sum: {$subtract: ['$revenue', '$expenses']}}
    }},
    {$sort: {profit: -1}},
    {$project: {
        _id: {
            type: '$_id.type',
            grade: '$_id.grade'
        },
        count: '$_id.count',
        expenses: '$_id.expenses',
        revenue: '$_id.revenue',
        profit: '$profit'
    }},
    {$out: 'treestat'}
])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One important thing to note about the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$out</code> operator is
it completely replaces the existing collection with the result of the aggregation<sup>2</sup>.  This
can accidentally wipe out an entire collection. Be careful!
</p>
<p>
Finally I got the tree count, expenses, revenue, and profits for all trees using the newly created
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">treestat</code> collection:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.treestat.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: 'all_trees',
        total_trees: {$sum: '$count'},
        total_expenses: {$sum: '$expenses'},
        total_revenue: {$sum: '$revenue'},
        total_profit: {$sum: '$profit'}
    }}
])

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : "all_trees",
    "total_trees" : 1001,
    "total_expenses" : 10220.5,
    "total_revenue" : 62245,
    "total_profit" : 52024.5
}
</CodeSnippet>

The aggregation framework is very powerful.  You can even use it to create a pseudo <code class="jarombek-inline-code">JOIN</code>
operation between collections<sup>3</sup>!  The source code for this discovery is on

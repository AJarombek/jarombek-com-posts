When I first heard about generators in the ES6 version of JavaScript, I wasn't quite sure
how useful they would be.  In this post I will look at the basics of generators in JavaScript
and other languages. In a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-26-2017-js-async-function">future post</a>
I'll explore how to combine Generators and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-21-2017-js-promises">Promises</a>.

<p>
The following code uses generators to create a fibonacci sequence.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function *fib() {
    var first = 0;
    var last = 1;

    yield first;
    yield last;

    while(true) {
        // ES6 Desconstructing shortens the traditional variable swap
        [first, last] = [last, first + last];

        yield last;
    }
}

var fibonacci = fib();

for(let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    let result = fibonacci.next();
    console.info(result.value);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To create a generator function in JavaScript the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">*</code>
token is placed next to a function.  When a generator function is invoked, it does not execute like a normal
function.  Instead it creates an iterator which is called to execute the functions contents.
Therefore the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">fibonacci</code> variable actually contains an
iterator that you can iterate over using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code>
function.  When <code className="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> is called, the
generator contents execute until the whole code body is run or a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword is encountered.  At this point a generator
is paused.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> statements can also return a value.  A returned value is placed in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> property of the iterator (which itself is an object).
I printed this property out when I called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">console.info(result.value)</code>.
</p>
<p>
One thing you may have noticed is the infinite <code className="jarombek-inline-code">while</code> loop
in the generator. Usually infinite loops should be avoided, but in generator bodies they are
completely okay!  The reason infinite loops are okay is because the user of the generator decides how many times the
iterator is called, so it won't necessarily run forever.
</p>
<p>
It is still possible for a generator to be called an infinite number of times.
In ES6 there is a new <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for...of</code> loop which is used to loop through the iterator
until completion.  In the fibonacci example, I did not use this loop because it would run forever!
</p>
<p>
I mentioned that the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword passes a value to the
outer code via the iterators <code className="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> property.  You can
also pass values back into the generator by adding a parameter to the iterators
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> function.  An example of passing values into generators
can be found in this articles <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/
2017/11-Nov/11-25-Generators">source code</a>.

<p>
JavaScript is not the only language with generators.  Amongst my commonly used languages Python and PHP also have
generators.  Let's look at an example in Python<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def fib():
    first = 0
    last = 1

    yield first
    yield last

    while True:
        # Construct and deconstruct a tuple
        first, last = last, first + last
        yield last

fibonacci = fib()
for x in range(50):
    print(next(fibonacci))
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the Python code is nearly identical - although you don't need the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">*</code> token next to the function definition.

When I first heard about generators in the ES6 version of JavaScript, I wasn't quite sure
how useful they would be.  In this post I will look at the basics of generators in JavaScript along
with other languages, and then explore some practical uses for it in a future
post on combining Generators and Promises.

</p>
<p>
To introduce generators I am going to use them to create the fibonacci sequence.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function *fib() {
    var first = 0;
    var last = 1;

    yield first;
    yield last;

    while(true) {
        // ES6 Desconstructing shortens the traditional variable swap
        [first, last] = [last, first + last];

        yield last;
    }
}

var fibonacci = fib();

for(let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    let result = fibonacci.next();
    console.info(result.value);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To create a generator function in JavaScript you put the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">*</code>
token next to a function.  When you call a generator function, it does not execute like a normal
function.  Instead it creates an iterator which can be called to execute the functions contents.
Therefore the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">fibonacci</code> variable actually contains an
iterator that you can iterate over using the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code>
function.  When the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> function is called, the
generator contents execute until the whole code body is run or a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword is encountered.  At this point the generator
is paused.  You can also return a value with a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code>
statement, as I did in the code above.  This value is placed in the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> property of the iterator (which is itself an object).
We print this property out when we call <code class="jarombek-inline-code">console.info(result.value)</code>.
</p>
<p>
One thing you may have noticed is the infinite <code class="jarombek-inline-code">while</code> loop
in the generator. Usually of course you should avoid infinite loops, but in generator bodies it is
completely okay!  This is because it is up to the user of the generator how many times they want to
call the iterator, so it won't necessarily run forever.
</p>
<p>
I say not necessarily because it is certainly possible for a generator to be called infinite times.
In ES6 there is a new forâ€¦of loop which is used to loop through the iterator until completion.  In
the fibonacci example, I did not use this loop because it would run forever!
</p>
<p>
I mentioned that the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword passes a value to the
outer code via the iterators <code class="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> property.  You can
also pass values back into the generator by adding a parameter to the iterators
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> function.  You can see an example of
this in this discoveries <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/
2017/11-Nov/11-25-Generators">source code</a>.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript is not the only language with generators.  Out of my main languages Python and PHP also have
generators.  Let's look at an example in Python<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
def fib():
    first = 0
    last = 1

    yield first
    yield last

    while True:
        # Construct and deconstruct a tuple
        first, last = last, first + last
        yield last

fibonacci = fib()
for x in range(50):
    print(next(fibonacci))
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see that the Python code is nearly identical - although you don't need the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">*</code> token next to the function definition.

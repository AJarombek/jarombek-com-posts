JavaScript has quickly become one of the languages I use the most (probably second behind Java).
Many people use JavaScript along with one of its many frontend frameworks (JQuery, AngularJS, etc.)
without really knowing how the core language operates.  I don't want to be one of those people!
</p>
<p>
This is my first of many discovery posts on JavaScript.  Let's look at one of the basic concepts
of the language: how variables interact with scope.  Scope describes the area of a program where a
variable is accessible (e.g. a variable declared in a function is only accessible within that function).
Scope is also the execution environment for each line of a program.  It consists of
the variables and functions a program line is aware of.  In JavaScript, scope can get a bit
tricky.
</p>
<p>
One tricky part is that declared variables in JavaScript get hoisted to the top of their scope.  Let's
look at a quick code snippet.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
console.info(x);  // Error??

var x = 10;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
For a Java developer like myself, I initially expected an error here.  Variable <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code> hasn't
been declared yet on line 1.  However, JavaScript returns <code class="jarombek-inline-code">undefined</code>,
which means the variable was declared but not initialized to a value.
</p>
<p>
What happened is JavaScript split the statement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var x = 10</code>
into its declaration and assignment.  It then ‘hoisted' the declaration to the top of the scope (in this
case the global program scope).  When <code class="jarombek-inline-code">console.info()</code> is invoked,
JavaScript is already aware of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var x</code>.
Tricky JavaScript!
</p>
<p>
If you are using ES6+ and don't want hoisting, you can use the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> keyword (simply replace
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> in
the previous example).  Now if you run the code again, invoking
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">console.info(x)</code> will throw an error.
</p>
<p>
Here is one more basic example:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
{
    let firstName = "Andy";
    var lastName = "Jarombek";

    console.info(firstName); // Andrew
    console.info(lastName); // Jarombek
}

console.info(lastName); // Jarombek
console.info(firstName); // Reference Error
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In JavaScript you can define a block scope with curly bracket syntax - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">{ }</code>.
In this code, the variable defined with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> is only available within
the block scope, while the variable defined with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> is
exposed to the global scope<sup>1</sup>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> is useful when
you want to constrain a variable to one small piece of code.
</p>
<p>
One thing that JavaScript block scope made me question was
'are variables defined with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> in functions available
globally?'  The answer is NO (thankfully) so your internally defined function variables are local and safe!

You can check out the full code for these examples on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2017/11-Nov/11-8-JS-Scope-Hoisting/
scope.js">GitHub</a>, along with a look at how variables in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">for</code>
loops leak into the global scope
(Yuck! – but there is a solution with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code>).

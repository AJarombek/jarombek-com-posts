In JavaScript there are many module patterns that can be used to create APIs and separate
concerns in code (as of ES6 there is actually syntax for modules in the specification).
In the following code I have created an API using the revealing module pattern.  The name comes
from the return statement at the end of the module - it 'reveals' functions to outside code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var taylorSwiftApi = function() {
    var lyric = {
        sparks: "I see sparks fly whenever you smile",
        mine: "You are the best thing thats ever been mine",
        dec: "I go back to Decemeber all the time",
        other: "I'm sorry, taylor can't pick up the phone right now"
    }

    function lyrics(song) {
        switch(song.toLowerCase()) {
            case "sparks fly":
            return lyric.sparks;
            case "mine":
            return lyric.mine;
            case "back to december":
            return lyric.dec;
            default:
            return lyric.other;
        }
    }

    return {
        lyrics: lyrics
    }
}();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This module shows Taylor Swift lyrics for songs that the user enters (because who doesn’t
enjoy some T-Swift!)  The return statement is the public API revealed to outside code.  All
interior details, such as the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">lyric</code> variable, are hidden.
This pattern harnesses the power of closure in JavaScript!
</p>
<p>
Closure has been defined as “when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope
even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope<sup>1</sup>.”
</p>
<p>
Okay cool, so even when we call <code class="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code> later
in the code it will be aware of the interior <code class="jarombek-inline-code">lyric</code> variable!
But what is this 'lexical scope' I see in the definition?
</p>
<p>
Lexical scope is when the physical structure of the program you write determines the scope.  Because
of this the scope in which you define a function in JavaScript
will always be that functions scope.  This scope is immutable and can’t be changed.
</p>
<p>
Maybe lexical scope and closure will be easier to understand with an example of us calling the Taylor Swift API:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var lyric = {
    sparks: "I was enchanted to meet you"
};

let result = taylorSwiftApi.lyrics("Sparks Fly");
console.info(result); // I see sparks fly whenever you smile
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see that in the global scope we define another variable named lyric with a different (and
as Swift fans know – incorrect) value.  The question is when we call
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code> which
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">lyric.sparks</code> variable will the API find?  In this case it
will be the one defined in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi</code> because of a
closure that was created over the lexical scope of the API.  The function
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code> was defined in the API functions lexical
scope, so that scope can’t change!
</p>

As I briefly mentioned in the beginning of this discovery there is support for modules in the JavaScript
spec as of ES6.  I will look at this Taylor Swift API using these modules in the future.  You can find
all the code for this discovery

11-9-JS-Closure-Modules/Source/module.js">HERE</a>.

<p>
A final note: there is another type of scoping called dynamic scope.  This is used in shell scripts such
as Bash and PowerShell.  In these scripting languages the scope is
determined by the executing programs location on the call stack<sup>2</sup>.  This may be a fun topic
to explore in the future!

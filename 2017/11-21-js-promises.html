Today I am looking at Promises in JavaScript and how we can use them to write easier to
follow and less error prone asynchronous code.  Before I talk about Promises lets make a
async call in JavaScript the traditional way; with callbacks. I won't be using any fancy
JavaScript framework to make my async http request, just the simple
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> object (which is as poorly named
as AJAX, it can be used for much more than XML!)<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I made a custom google search API which is actually really easy and fun to create<sup>2</sup>!
It searches certain websites for cat related posts (and is appropriately called meowmeow)!
Who wouldn't love that?  So in my code I want to get the article names of the
top 10 searches of my custom meow search.  Here is how you would do that with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> and callback function:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

httpRequest.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/#', true);
httpRequest.send();

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {

    if (httpRequest.status === 200 && httpRequest.readyState === 4) {
        var json = JSON.parse(httpRequest.response);

        for (let item of json.items) {
            console.info(item.title);
        }
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>

<p>
I won't go into how the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> object works in this
post but you can see that the callback function is placed in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
onreadystatechange</code> function.  This gets even uglier because <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
onreadystatechange</code> is called multiple times for each request.  This is why we must check if the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">readyState === 4</code>, in which 4 represents the request being
done<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
There are some obvious issues with this callback function approach.  What happens if the request
errors out?  In this code we have no error handling so the result of an unsuccessful call to our google
search is unclear.  Also what if we need to make another asynchronous call after this request is completed?
In this case you would need nested callback functions which quickly becomes ugly and hard to
follow, commonly referred to as callback hell.
</p>
<p>
These are just a few of the reasons to move away from callbacks and to a more elegant solution - promises!
A promise object is a value that currently does not exist but is guaranteed to exist in the future.
With promises we can have error handling for asynchronous code and hide some of the asynchronous details
inside the promise definition.  Let's look at how the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code>
will look using promises:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function httpMeow() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

        httpRequest.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=AIzaSyA2QIPJoGYMx_DuQH6wDqNG3AHXG7bcb94' +
                '&cx=005720647135116730303:chkg-pnyocg&q=meow&prettyPrint=false', true);

        httpRequest.onload = function success() {
            if (httpRequest.status === 200) {
                resolve(httpRequest.response);
            } else {
                reject("no meow was heard :(");
            }
        };
        httpRequest.onerror = function error() {
            reject("no meow was heard :(");
        };
        httpRequest.send();
    });
}

httpMeow().then(function(response) {
    var json = JSON.parse(response);

    for (let item of json.items) {
        console.info(item.title);
    }
}, function(err) {
    console.info(err);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You will notice that this code is broken up into two parts.  First we have the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">httpMeow()</code> function which returns a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Promise</code> object.  You can think of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">httpMeow()</code> as a reusable function to execute our http
requests, hiding the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> details from outer
code.  With the promise you can either reject or resolve the currently non-existing
value.  This is represented in our code by the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">resolve()</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">reject()</code> functions in the promise.
</p>
<p>
The second part of the code interacts with the created promise.  Every <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Promise</code> object has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">then()</code> function
which is called once the promise value exists.  You can see <code class="jarombek-inline-code">then()</code>
is supplied two functions, the first which is called when the promise is resolved, the second when it
is rejected.  You can see this solution is nice since we don't need to know the details
of the promise, just supply it the details of what to do on success and failure.
</p>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> function also has the benefit of returning a
Promise<sup>4</sup>.  This means that we can chain promises, as shown in the pseudocode below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
httpMeow()
    .then(/* Get all the article titles */)
    .then(/* Get all the article dates */)
    .then(/* Get all the article URLs */);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can imagine all the possibilities with chained promises (and escaping callback hell!).  Other
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Promise</code> object functions include
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">all()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">race()</code>,
which resolve or reject the promised value after all promises are completed or the
first completes respectively<sup>5</sup>.  You can look at all the code from this discovery

Today I am looking at Promises in JavaScript and how they are used to write easy to follow
 and error resistant asynchronous code.  Before writing any Promises I made an
async call in JavaScript the traditional way; with callbacks. I didn't use any fancy
JavaScript framework to make my async http request, just the simple
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> object (which is as poorly named
as AJAX - it can be used for much more than XML!)<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I made a custom google search API which was really easy and fun to create<sup>2</sup>!
It searches certain websites for cat related posts (and is appropriately called meowmeow)!
Who wouldn't love that?  In my code I retrieve the article names from the
top 10 searches in my custom meow search.  The code uses the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> object and a callback function:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

httpRequest.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/#', true);
httpRequest.send();

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {

    if (httpRequest.status === 200 && httpRequest.readyState === 4) {
        var json = JSON.parse(httpRequest.response);

        for (let item of json.items) {
            console.info(item.title);
        }
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>

<p>
I won't explain the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> object in detail here
but you can see that the callback function is placed on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
onreadystatechange</code> property.  This approach gets pretty ugly since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
onreadystatechange</code> is called multiple times for each request.  Due to multiple invocations I checked if
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">readyState === 4</code>, where 4 represents the request being
done<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
There are obvious issues with this callback function approach.  What happens if the request
errors out?  This code has no error handling so the result of an unsuccessful call to the custom google
search is unclear.  Also what if I need to make a second asynchronous call after this request is completed?
Using callbacks I would need nested callback functions, which quickly becomes ugly and hard to
follow.  This is commonly referred to as callback hell.
</p>
<p>
These are just a few of the reasons to move away from callbacks to a more elegant solution - promises!
A promise object is a value that currently does not exist but is guaranteed to exist in the future.
With promises it is easy to write error handling for asynchronous code and hide some of the asynchronous details
inside the promise definition.  Let's see how <code className="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code>
works using promises:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function httpMeow() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

        httpRequest.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=AIzaSyA2QIPJoGYMx_DuQH6wDqNG3AHXG7bcb94' +
                '&cx=005720647135116730303:chkg-pnyocg&q=meow&prettyPrint=false', true);

        httpRequest.onload = function success() {
            if (httpRequest.status === 200) {
                resolve(httpRequest.response);
            } else {
                reject("no meow was heard :(");
            }
        };
        httpRequest.onerror = function error() {
            reject("no meow was heard :(");
        };
        httpRequest.send();
    });
}

httpMeow().then(function(response) {
    var json = JSON.parse(response);

    for (let item of json.items) {
        console.info(item.title);
    }
}, function(err) {
    console.info(err);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code is broken up into two parts.  First the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">httpMeow()</code> function returns a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Promise</code> object.  You can think of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">httpMeow()</code> as a reusable function to execute http
requests, hiding the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">XMLHttpRequest</code> details from outside
code.  A promise can either reject or resolve a currently non-existent
value.  This is represented in code by the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">resolve()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">reject()</code> functions in the promise.
</p>
<p>
The second part of the code interacts with the created promise.  Every <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Promise</code> object has a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">then()</code> function
which is called once the promise value exists.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">then()</code>
is supplied two functions, the first which is called when the promise is resolved, the second when it
is rejected.  With this solution I'm not required to know the details
of the promise and can simply supply it with actions to perform on success or failure.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">next()</code> function also has the benefit of returning a
Promise<sup>4</sup>.  This allows for chained promises, as shown in the pseudocode below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
httpMeow()
    .then(/* Get all the article titles */)
    .then(/* Get all the article dates */)
    .then(/* Get all the article URLs */);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Chained promises help with readability and are an escape from callback hell!  Other
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Promise</code> object methods include
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">all()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">race()</code>,
which resolve or reject a value after all promises complete or the
first promise completes (respectively)<sup>5</sup>.  You can read all the code from this discovery on

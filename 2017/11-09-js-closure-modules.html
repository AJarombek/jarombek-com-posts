In JavaScript there are multiple module patterns for creating APIs and separating
concerns in code (as of ES6 there is also official module syntax in the spec).
In the following code I created an API using the revealing module pattern.  The name 'revealing module pattern' comes
from the return statement at the end of the module - it 'reveals' functions to outside code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var taylorSwiftApi = function() {
    var lyric = {
        sparks: "I see sparks fly whenever you smile",
        mine: "You are the best thing that's ever been mine",
        dec: "I go back to December all the time",
        other: "I'm sorry, taylor can't pick up the phone right now"
    }

    function lyrics(song) {
        switch(song.toLowerCase()) {
            case "sparks fly":
                return lyric.sparks;
            case "mine":
                return lyric.mine;
            case "back to december":
                return lyric.dec;
            default:
                return lyric.other;
        }
    }

    return {
        lyrics: lyrics
    }
}();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This module provides lyrics for Taylor Swift songs (because who doesn't
enjoy some T-Swift!)  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">return</code> statement is the public API for the module.  All
interior details, such as the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyric</code> variable, are hidden.
This pattern harnesses the power of closure in JavaScript!
</p>
<p>
Closure is defined "when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope
even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope<sup>1</sup>."
</p>
<p>
Okay cool, so when <code className="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code> is invoked later
on, it will remember the modules interior <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyric</code> variable!
But what is this 'lexical scope' the definition refers to?
</p>
<Definition word="Lexical Scope">
Lexical scope is when the physical structure of a program determines the scope.  Because
of this, the scope in which you define a function
is always that functions scope.  The lexical scope attached to a function can never change.
</Definition>
<p>
Maybe lexical scope and closure will be easier to understand with an example using the Taylor Swift API:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var lyric = {
    sparks: "I was enchanted to meet you"
};

let result = taylorSwiftApi.lyrics("Sparks Fly");
console.info(result); // I see sparks fly whenever you smile
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the global scope I defined a second <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyric</code> variable with a different (and
as T-Swift fans know – incorrect) value.  The question now is which
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyric.sparks</code> variable will the API find
when invoking <code className="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code>?  In this case, it
will be the one defined in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi</code> module.  This is because of a
closure that was created over the lexical scope of the API.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwiftApi.lyrics()</code> was defined in the API's lexical
scope, so that scope can’t change!
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned in the beginning of this discovery, there is support for modules in the JavaScript
spec as of ES6.  I will expand on the Taylor Swift API using
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-10-2017-es6-modules-babel">ES6 modules</a> in the future.  You can find
all the code from this article on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2017/
11-Nov/11-9-JS-Closure-Modules/module.js">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
A final note: there is another type of scoping called dynamic scope.  This is used in shell scripts such
as Bash and PowerShell.  In these scripting languages, the scope is
determined by the executing programs location on the call stack<sup>2</sup>.  This may be a fun topic
to explore in the future!

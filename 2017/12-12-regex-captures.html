Regular expressions are commonly used in my code.  However, there are still certain aspects of
them that remain a mystery to me.  Today I'm exploring one new aspect of regular expressions
- captures.  Although JavaScript is used in this post, the following concepts apply to many languages with
regex capabilities (including my main language Java).  Let's dig in.
</p>
<p>
Captures help save pieces of a regular expression for later use.  For example, if a regex matches emails,
I can capture the two main pieces of an email - the local-part and the domain.  The following code saves
the day, month, and year from a date.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let date = "02/26/1995";

let pattern = /(\d{1,2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4})/;
let captures = date.match(pattern);

console.info(captures); // ["02/26/1995", "02", "26", "1995"]

// The captures are accessed from the array produced by match()
console.info(`Month: ${captures[1]}, Day: ${captures[2]}, Year: ${captures[3]}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The grouping syntax <code className="jarombek-inline-code">(...)</code> is used to define a capture.  The
value matched to a capture is saved to an array when the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">match()</code>
function is called.
</p>
<p>
If I want to use grouping but don't need to capture pieces of a regular expression, the syntax
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">(?: ...)</code> specifies that a group shouldn't create a capture.
This results in less work for the languages engine to perform<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let pattern2 = /(?:\d{1,2})\/(?:\d{2})\/(?:\d{4})/;
let captures2 = date.match(pattern2);
console.info(captures2); // ["02/26/1995"]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One final thing to explore with captures is backreferences.  Backreferences refer to previous captures
created in the same regular expression<sup>2</sup>.  In the following code I used backreferences to check if the month and
day in a date are equal.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">\1</code> token refers to the contents of
the first capture (the month).  The contents of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">\1</code> is defined at runtime.  Backreferences
make regular expressions even more dynamic!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let date = "02/26/1995";
let date2 = "02/02/2017";

let sameDayMonthPattern = /(\d{1,2})\/\1\/\d{4}/;

let fails = sameDayMonthPattern.test(date);
let succeeds = sameDayMonthPattern.test(date2);

console.info(fails); // false
console.info(succeeds); // true
</CodeSnippet>

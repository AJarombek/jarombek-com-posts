Regular expressions are very commonly used in my code.  However, their are still certain aspects of
them that have remained a mystery to me.  Today I will explore one new aspect of regular expressions
- captures.  I will write the code for captures in JavaScript but they apply to many languages with
regex capabilities (including my main language Java).  Let's dig in.
</p>
<p>
Captures allow us to save pieces of a regular expression so we can use them later on.  For example,
it we have a regex that matches emails, we can capture certain aspects of the email - the local part
and the domain.  We can also do the same thing with dates - saving
the day, month, and year.  That is what happens in the following example:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let date = "02/26/1995";

let pattern = /(\d{1,2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4})/;
let captures = date.match(pattern);

console.info(captures); // ["02/26/1995", "02", "26", "1995"]

// The captures can be accessed from the array produced by match()
console.info(`Month: ${captures[1]}, Day: ${captures[2]}, Year: ${captures[3]}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
We use the grouping syntax <code class="jarombek-inline-code">(...)</code> to define a capture.  The
value matched inside this capture is then saved into an array when the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">match()</code> function is called on the string.  We can then access
this arrays elements, as shown on the last line.
</p>
<p>
If we want to use grouping but don't need to capture pieces of our regular expression, JavaScript allows
us to specify that a group shouldn't create a capture with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">(?: ...)</code> syntax.  This will result in less work for the
languages engine to perform<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let pattern2 = /(?:\d{1,2})\/(?:\d{2})\/(?:\d{4})/;
let captures2 = date.match(pattern2);
console.info(captures2); // ["02/26/1995"]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One final thing to explore with captures is backreferences.  This allows us to refer to previous captures
created in the same regular expression<sup>2</sup>.  We can use backreferences to check if the month and
day in our dates are equal.  In the following code the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">\1</code>
token will refer to the contents of the first capture (the month) which is defined at runtime.  Now
our regular expressions are even more dynamic!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let date = "02/26/1995";
let date2 = "02/02/2017";

let sameDayMonthPattern = /(\d{1,2})\/\1\/\d{4}/;

let fails = sameDayMonthPattern.test(date);
let succeeds = sameDayMonthPattern.test(date2);

console.info(fails); // false
console.info(succeeds); // true
</CodeSnippet>

In many languages I have worked with creating getters and setters for private class variables is
a common practice.  In Java getters and setters are implemented as two functions which can be
called directly on an object instance.  They are commonly used in the POJO structure.  In JavaScript
getters and setters have native support in the language itself.  You can create these getters and setters
with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">get</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">set</code>
keywords.  They are commonly used for computing properties, as shown in the next example.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
    var person = {
        _first: 'Andy',
        _last: 'Jarombek',
        get full() {
            console.info('Accessing Full Name');
            // Use ES6 template literals
            return `${this._first} ${this._last}`;
        }
    };
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can also use setters to perform validation on incoming data.  In the dynamically typed JavaScript
language we can implement a strictly typed variable<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var person = {
    _first: 'Andy',
    _last: 'Jarombek',
    set first(str) {
        console.info('Setting First Name');
        if (typeof str === 'string' || str instanceof String) {
            var s = str.toLowerCase();
            this._first = s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
        } else {
            throw new TypeError('First Name Must be a String');
        }
    }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see that we can perform any sort of logic inside our getters and setters.  To make things even
nicer we don't have to call a function to use our native getters and setters.  We just have to assign a
value or access a property just like any normal object property!

Out of all the other languages I use, the only other one with native getter and setter support like
JavaScript is Swift<sup>2</sup>.  You can check out the full getter and setter code in both languages

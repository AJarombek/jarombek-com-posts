In my last discovery post, I went over the
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-9-2017-js-closure-modules">revealing module pattern in JavaScript.</a>
Now I am recreating the same API with ES6 modules.  The API code will look familiar:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
export function lyrics(song) {
    switch(song.toLowerCase()) {
    case "sparks fly":
        return lyric.sparks;
        case "mine":
        return lyric.mine;
    case "back to december":
        return lyric.dec;
    default:
        return lyric.other;
    }
}

var lyric = {
    sparks: "I see sparks fly whenever you smile",
    mine: "You are the best thing thats ever been mine",
    dec: "I go back to Decemeber all the time",
    other: "I'm sorry, taylor can't pick up the phone right now"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The only change to the API is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">export</code> keyword.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">export</code> is a new keyword in ES6 that reveals the function
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyrics</code> to other JavaScript code.  Any JavaScript file can
be a module if it exports functions/variables.
Only one module can exist per file, and each module can export multiple items.  Since one file
is one and only one module, the name of a module is the filename. Code to import a module
uses the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">import</code> keyword:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import * as ts from './taylorSwift';
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All variables/functions in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">taylorSwift</code> module are
imported with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">import *</code> syntax.
The imported module is then given the alias
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ts</code>. With the Taylor Swift API imported, I invoked the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">lyrics()</code> function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
ts.lyrics("Sparks Fly");
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you tried running this code in certain environments it would fail.  Many JavaScript engines are not
ES6 compliant (including my version of Node.js!).  Therefore, when I tried running my main.js file
(containing the input code) I got an error:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
node main.js
#import * as ts from 'taylorSwift';
#^^^^^^
#SyntaxError: Unexpected token import
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Eventually I got this code to work after jumping through some hoops.
The tool to get the job done was Babel, which is a JavaScript transpiler.
</p>
<p>
The way to get ES6 code to work in all environments is by converting it to
an ES5 equivalent (or as close as possible).  This would be quite the task to do manually,
so Babel does the work for us.  As I mentioned, Babel is a transpiler.  Transpile is a
combination of the words translate and
compile.  So Babel (a compiler) converts (translates) ES6 code to ES5.
</p>
<p>
Let’s set up Babel.  Since I’m using Node.js I set up a dependency manager and installed Babel<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
npm install --save-dev babel-cli
npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I then configured Babel by creating a .babelrc file.  In this JSON file I set
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">presets</code> to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">"env"</code>,
which helps Babel determine the Babel plugins I need to perform a transpilation based on
my environment<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now when I got to this point I thought "great I’m done! Let’s run the code!"  Unfortunately, I forgot
to actually tell Babel which files to convert to ES5.  One way to do that is like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
npx babel main.js --out-file es5/main.js
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This command tells Babel to take main.js and transpile it to a file of the same name in a folder named es5
(note: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">npx</code> is not a typo – install
it with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">npm install –g npx</code> to simplify Babel commands).
</p>
<p>
There is however a better way of doing this.  Babel has the ability to watch ES6 files for changes.
When a change is made, the ES6 code is automatically transpiled to an output file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
npx babel main.js --watch --out-file es5/main.js &
npx babel taylorSwift.js --watch --out-file es5/taylorSwift.js &
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I added the ampersand to the end of these commands to place them in the background.
This is so the bash shell is not blocked and I can continue to execute commands in one window.
Background tasks can be killed at any time with their job number<sup>3</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Kill the task by job number (in this case 1)
kill %1
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now Babel is all set and the files are transpiled!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
node es5/main.js
# I see sparks fly whenever you smile
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Looking at the transpiled ES5 code reveals that Babel is using CommonJS for the ES6 modules.  This is
the library that Node.js uses for modules in pre-ES6 code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
var _taylorSwift = require("./taylorSwift");
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
That was a lot of work just to see some sparks fly using ES6!  Obviously it is not practical to
transpile ES6 code for such a small codebase, but for larger projects we want
to use ES6+ JavaScript features no matter the environment.  I'll be using Babel for many
projects in the future.  You can find all the code in this demo on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/

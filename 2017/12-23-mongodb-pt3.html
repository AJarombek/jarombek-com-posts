One of the really powerful things about a document database like MongoDB is the ability to store arrays
of values in a document.  This array itself can even store sub-documents, allowing for many levels of
nested data.
</p>
<p>
An example of an array in a document being useful could be a user that has multiple addresses.  In a
relational database, this address information would have to be stored in a separate table that could be
joined on the user table to get all the addresses.  In MongoDB, this can all be stored in one document
which makes accessing quick and easy (no expensive <code class="jarombek-inline-code">JOIN</code> operations)
as well as simplifying updating.
</p>
<p>
Now let's look at some operations we can do on arrays from the MongoDB shell.  I created a document
called <code class="jarombek-inline-code">user</code> which will hold running log information.  This
info consists of an array of exercise logs, an array of planned exercises, and the users
personal records.
</p>
<p>
Accessing data from nested objects and arrays is easy.  Lets say we have a plan array that contains
exercise plans.  These plans contain two properties - a date and a distance in miles.  If we want to
just return the miles and not the date, we can do this using dot notation -
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">plan.miles</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.user.find({}, {'plan.miles': 1}).pretty()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you wanted to just return the first item in the plan array to see the next run you have to go on,
you can use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$slice</code> operator.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
$slice</code> allows you to determine a number of items to return from an array.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.user.find({}, {_id: 1, plan: {$slice: 1}}).pretty()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
We pass <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$slice</code> a value of 1 which says to only return the
first element from the array.  You can give <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$slice</code> a
negative value to return from the end of the array.
</p>
<p>
    Like any property, you can put an index on a nested property using dot notation:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.user.createIndex({'plan.date': 1})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can update an array with numerous operators including <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$push</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$pop</code>, and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$addToSet</code>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$pop</code> removes an item from the array, while both
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$push</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$addToSet</code> add
an item to the array.  The difference is with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$addToSet</code> the new
item will only be added if it does not already exist in the array.  This is a safer
option if we want to avoid duplicates.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// Delete the first element of the plan array
db.user.update({}, {$pop: {'plan': -1}})

// Add an element to the array if it does not already exist
db.user.update({}, {$addToSet: {'plan': {date: new Date("2017-12-27"), miles: 2}}})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One important operator for updating in MongoDB is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">findAndModify()</code>.
This command allows you to both update a document and return the new document atomically<sup>1</sup>.  All
updates in MongoDB are performed atomically (an update is never half completed and
no database connection ever sees an update in progress).  However, when you do
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">update()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">find()</code>
operations separately, there is a chance that another update is performed in between the execution of
both commands.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">findAndModify()</code> eliminates this problem so you know
any changes reflected in the document are from the update just performed. The following query will
add another sub-document to the plan array and also return the new updated document.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.user.findAndModify({
    query: {},
    update: {
        $addToSet: {'plan': {date: new Date("2017-12-28"), miles: 4.1}}
    },
    'new': true
})
</CodeSnippet>

These code samples begin to expose the power of arrays and sub-documents in MongoDB.  With them you can
combine what would be many tables in a RDBMS into a single document.  All the code samples are found

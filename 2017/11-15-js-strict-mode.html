One JavaScript feature I've used before but never fully understood is strict mode.
Strict mode restricts certain features and leniencies in the language<sup>1</sup>.
It protects the developer from things that happen implicitly in JavaScript (that only an
experienced dev would be aware of).  In a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-11-2017-js-this">
previous discovery</a> I looked at how strict mode disallows <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>
from containing the global scope variable.  What else does strict mode have to offer?
</p>
<p>
Certain things that silently fail in JavaScript throw errors when executed in strict mode.  This
includes setting properties to primitives and assigning values to keywords.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
try {
    undefined = "defined!";
} catch(e) {
    console.error('Strict mode disallows assigning values to keywords');
}

try {
    false.not = true;
} catch(e) {
    console.error('Strict mode disallows setting properties for primitive values');
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Strict mode also disallows duplicate parameter names for functions.  In previous JavaScript versions it restricted
duplicate property names on objects, but this restriction was lifted in ES6 (either a bug or poor design choice).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// Strict mode does not throw an error for duplicate property names
var andy = {
    name: "Andy J",
    name: "whoops",
    /* Strict mode disallows duplicate parameter names for functions
    func: function(a, b, a) {
        console.info(a + b + c);
    }*/
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Strict mode also stops variable creation when assigning a
value to an undeclared variable without a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code>, or <code class="jarombek-inline-code">const</code> keyword.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
try {
    hey = "hello"
} catch(e) {
    console.error('Strict mode disallows assigning to undeclared variables');
    console.error(e);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Without strict mode forgetting the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> or
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> variable is "forgiving."  If
the variable is not defined, JavaScript creates a new global variable with the name provided.
In my opinion this should be considered a syntax mistake by the developer
and throw an error.  That is exactly what happens in strict mode.
</p>
<p>
Strict mode includes other features that can come in useful (such as throwing errors when trying
to assign values to immutable properties) but the ones I went over have the largest impact on my code.

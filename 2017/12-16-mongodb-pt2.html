    Today I will continue with my
    <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions/blob/master/Discoveries/2017/12-Dec/
    12-15-MongoDB-Pt1/View/mongodb1.html">first MongoDB discovery</a>
    and look at documents in more depth.  To start, let's look at how we would
    handle the purchase of a Christmas tree in our database.  The first thing we need to do is pick a tree
    to buy!  We can search the database for a tree to our liking and use the <code>findOne()</code> function
    to return a single tree.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.findOne({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""})

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5a3352702e48ee76cb1fe459"),
    "type" : "douglas",
    "height" : "7' 3\"",
    "source_price" : 10,
    "sell_price" : 60,
    "grade" : "7-8ft",
    "sold" : false,
    "buyer_id" : undefined
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now we need to create a customer collection to hold all the people who are buying trees:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.customer.insert({
    username: "andy",
    name: "Andrew Jarombek",
    email: "andy@jarombek.com"
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One thing you may have noticed is that each document has a field called <code>_id</code> with an
<code>ObjectId(...)</code> containing a hex number.  You may think that the hex digits are just
randomly generated but they actually hold organized information.  The first eight hex digits (four bytes)
or the <code>ObjectId</code> are actually a timestamp of the time when the id was created.  The rest of
the id is broken down into three pieces - the machine ID, process ID, and a counter which increments
each time an <code>ObjectId</code> is generated in this particular process.  All these items
together creates a very reliable unique key (you don't have to worry about collisions - the possibility
of that is so small).
</p>
<p>
So why am I going into the details of the <code>ObjectId</code> object?  That is because we can use
these unique ids to link documents together by having a document property value containing the id of
another document.  In the case of our Christmas tree database, we want a collection for purchases.  In this
collection, our documents will be linked to both the tree purchased and the customer.  To do this we can
take the tree and customer documents ids and put them in the purchase document.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let tree_id = db.tree.findOne({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""})._id;
let user_id = db.customer.findOne()._id;

db.purchase.insert({
    type: "douglas",
    grade: "7-8ft",
    price: 60,
    tree_id: tree_id,
    username: "andy",
    user_id: user_id,
    date: Date()
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code also displays our ability in MongoDB to use JavaScript variables in the query language.  This
allows for more readable and structured queries.
Now when we look at the purchase document we can see the other documents ids:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.purchase.findOne()

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5a34a1942e48ee76cb1fe82c"),
    "type" : "douglas",
    "grade" : "7-8ft",
    "price" : 60,
    "tree_id" : ObjectId("5a3352702e48ee76cb1fe459"),
    "username" : "andy",
    "user_id" : ObjectId("5a349e732e48ee76cb1fe82b"),
    "date" : "Fri Dec 15 2017 23:31:16 GMT-0500 (EST)"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You will also notice some duplicated fields from other collections in the purchase document (such as
the <code>username</code> property). This sort of duplication is frowned upon in a RDBMS, however with
no JOINs in MongoDB this duplication is okay<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Now you have seen how we can link related documents in MongoDB which allows us to find a linked document
without a JOIN operation.  Let's take a step back and look at the first query we made picking out a Christmas
tree.  We can call the <code>explain()</code> function on our query to find useful information on its execution:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.find({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""}).explain("executionStats")

/* Result */
{
    "executionStats" : {
        "executionSuccess" : true,
        "nReturned" : 6,
        "executionTimeMillis" : 4,
        "totalKeysExamined" : 0,
        "totalDocsExamined" : 1003,
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The important property we look at on the returned JSON object is
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">totalDocsExamined</code>.  You
can see that our query looked at every single document in our collection.  Now imagine how slow this
could be if we had millions of documents in our collection!  For anyone who has used databases before
the answer should come to mind - an index.  Let's add indexes on the fields in tree we are querying against.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.createIndex({type: 1})
db.tree.createIndex({grade: 1})
db.tree.createIndex({height: 1})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You may be wondering what the significance is of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">1</code> value.
This means that the index is stored in ascending order (an index is basically a map with keys and values),
while a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">-1</code> would
mean descending<sup>2</sup>.  Now if we do the same query
and call <code class="jarombek-inline-code">explain()</code>, only the returned documents are examined.
Much better!
</p>
<p>
We can view all the indexes on a document with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">getIndexes()</code>
function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.getIndexes()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Indexes can be used for other purposes other than just speeding up query times.  We can use them to
expire documents in what is called a time-to-live (TTL) collection<sup>3</sup>.  These collections
use indexes to set a date for when a document expires.  To do this, we first need to set a date
property on our tree documents.  This date will be Christmas eve, since you won't be able to buy a
tree anymore after this date.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.updateMany({}, {$set: {"availableUntil": new Date("2017-12-24")}})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now we can create an index on this <code class="jarombek-inline-code">availableUntil</code> property.
The second parameter to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">createIndex()</code> supplies additional
options, and in this case we want to expire the document zero seconds after the date in the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">availableUntil</code> property<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.createIndex({availableUntil: 1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 0})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
We added a lot of new MongoDB concepts to our tree database.  The power of linked documents and indexes
in MongoDB are becoming apparent.  I will look at MongoDB even more in my next discovery.  The code for
this discovery can be found <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions/blob/master/

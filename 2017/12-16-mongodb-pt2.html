Today I'm building on my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">first MongoDB discovery</a>
and looking at documents in more depth.  To start, let's implement Christmas
tree purchases in the database.  The first task is picking a tree to buy!  I searched the database for a tree I
liked and used the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findOne()</code> function to return a single tree.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.findOne({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""})

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5a3352702e48ee76cb1fe459"),
    "type" : "douglas",
    "height" : "7' 3\"",
    "source_price" : 10,
    "sell_price" : 60,
    "grade" : "7-8ft",
    "sold" : false,
    "buyer_id" : undefined
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Next I created a customer collection to hold all the people who bought trees:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.customer.insert({
    username: "andy",
    name: "Andrew Jarombek",
    email: "andy@jarombek.com"
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One thing you may have noticed is that each document has a field called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">_id</code>
with a value of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ObjectId(...)</code> containing a hex number.  These hex
digits are not randomly generated.  Instead they hold organized information about the document.  The first eight hex digits
(four bytes) of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ObjectId</code> are a timestamp of
when the id was created.  The rest of the id is broken down into three pieces - the machine ID, process ID,
and a counter which increments each time an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ObjectId</code> is generated.
All these items together create a very reliable unique key (you don't have to worry
about collisions, the possibility is so small).
</p>
<p>
So why am I going into the details of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ObjectId</code>?  These
unique ids are commonly used to link documents together by creating a property on one document that contains the id of
another document.  In the case of the Christmas tree database, I created a collection for purchases.  In this
collection, each document is linked to both the purchased tree and the customer.  I took
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">tree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">customer</code> document
ids and put them in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">purchase</code> document.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
let tree_id = db.tree.findOne({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""})._id;
let user_id = db.customer.findOne()._id;

db.purchase.insert({
    type: "douglas",
    grade: "7-8ft",
    price: 60,
    tree_id: tree_id,
    username: "andy",
    user_id: user_id,
    date: Date()
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code also displays the ability to use JavaScript variables in MongoDB queries.  Variables allow
for readable and structured queries. Now I can see the other document ids in the purchase document:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.purchase.findOne()

/* Result */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5a34a1942e48ee76cb1fe82c"),
    "type" : "douglas",
    "grade" : "7-8ft",
    "price" : 60,
    "tree_id" : ObjectId("5a3352702e48ee76cb1fe459"),
    "username" : "andy",
    "user_id" : ObjectId("5a349e732e48ee76cb1fe82b"),
    "date" : "Fri Dec 15 2017 23:31:16 GMT-0500 (EST)"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You will notice there are some duplicated fields from other collections in the purchase document (such as
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">username</code> property). This sort of duplication is frowned upon in a RDBMS,
however since there are no JOINs in MongoDB duplication is okay<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I've demonstrated how to link related documents in MongoDB, making it easy to find a linked document
without a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">JOIN</code> operation.  Let's take a step back and look at the first
query I made for picking out a Christmas tree.  I called the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">explain()</code>
function on this query to find useful execution information:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.find({type:"douglas", grade:"7-8ft", height:"7' 3\""}).explain("executionStats")

/* Result */
{
    "executionStats" : {
        "executionSuccess" : true,
        "nReturned" : 6,
        "executionTimeMillis" : 4,
        "totalKeysExamined" : 0,
        "totalDocsExamined" : 1003,
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The most important property in the returned JSON object is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">totalDocsExamined</code>.
Notice that the query looked at every single document in the collection.  Now imagine how slow this
could be if there were millions of documents in the collection!  For anyone who has used databases before
the solution should come to mind - an index.  Let's add indexes to the commonly queried fields in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">tree</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.createIndex({type: 1})
db.tree.createIndex({grade: 1})
db.tree.createIndex({height: 1})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You may be wondering about the significance of the value <code className="jarombek-inline-code">1</code>.
This means that the index is stored in ascending order, while a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">-1</code> means
descending order<sup>2</sup>.  When I call <code className="jarombek-inline-code">explain()</code> again,
only the returned documents are examined.  Much better!
</p>
<p>
All the indexes on a document are displayed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getIndexes()</code> function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.tree.getIndexes()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Indexes are used for other purposes besides speeding up query times.  They can
expire documents in a time-to-live (TTL) collection<sup>3</sup>.  These collections
use indexes to set a date that a document expires.  In order to create a TTL collection, a date property
needs to exist on the documents.  In the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">tree</code> documents I set
this date to Christmas eve, since nobody will buy a tree after then.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">

db.tree.updateMany({}, {$set: {"availableUntil": new Date("2017-12-24")}})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Next I created an index on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">availableUntil</code> property.
The second parameter of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">createIndex()</code> contains additional
options, in this case expiring the document zero seconds after the date in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">availableUntil</code><sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">

db.tree.createIndex({availableUntil: 1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 0})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I applied a lot of new MongoDB concepts to the tree database.  The power of linked documents and indexes
in MongoDB is now clear.  I will look at MongoDB even more in my next discovery.  The code for
this discovery can be found on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/
2017/12-Dec/12-16-MongoDB-Pt2/dbscrips.js">GitHub</a>.

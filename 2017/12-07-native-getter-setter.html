Creating getters and setters for private class variables is a common practice in many languages.  In
Java getters and setters are implemented as two methods on an object instance.
Getters and setters are often used in the POJO structure.  In JavaScript
getters and setters have native support in the language itself.  JavaScript getters and setters are created
with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">get</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">set</code>
keywords.  They are commonly used for computing properties, as shown in the next example.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var person = {
    _first: 'Andy',
    _last: 'Jarombek',
    get full() {
        console.info('Accessing Full Name');
        // Use ES6 template literals
        return `${this._first} ${this._last}`;
    }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Setters can also perform validation on incoming data, such as type checking<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
var person = {
    _first: 'Andy',
    _last: 'Jarombek',
    set first(str) {
        console.info('Setting First Name');
        if (typeof str === 'string' || str instanceof String) {
            var s = str.toLowerCase();
            this._first = s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
        } else {
            throw new TypeError('First Name Must be a String');
        }
    }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Any sort of logic can be performed inside getters and setters.  To make things even
nicer a function invocation isn't needed to utilize native getters and setters.  Value assignments and
property accesses with getters and setters work just like any normal object property!

Out of all the languages I use, the only other one with native getter and setter support is Swift<sup>2</sup>.

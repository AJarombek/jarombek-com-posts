In many programming languages arrow functions are added to allow for concise one liners and
decreased verbosity.  Less lines of code is one of the things that made the Java 8 release with
lambdas so appealing.  In ES6 JavaScript also added arrow functions to write
shorter, more readable code.  In JavaScript however these new functions aren’t as universally
praised due to some quirks.
</p>
<p>
In JavaScript I have
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-11-2017-js-this">looked at</a>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> and how
it is set dynamically at runtime instead of lexically depending on the scope code is written in.  I
also went over how many JavaScript users (including myself!) are easily confused by how
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> works in the language.  Arrow functions look to ‘fix’
these confusions by implementing a lexical <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>.  Now the value of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in an arrow function depends on what
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> is equal to at the time it was written (instead
of where it is called).  This leads to confusing behavior if you are expecting arrow functions to act
like normal function definitions.  Let’s look at an example.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
'use strict';

function mult() {
    this.x = 50;

    var x2Arrow = () => {
        console.info(this);
        return this.x * 2;
    };

    var x2 = function times2() {
        console.info(this);
        return this.x * 2;
    };

    return {x2, x2Arrow};
}

var m = new mult();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In this example we have a function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">mult()</code> which creates
an API for multiplying the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> value by two.  Since we use
the constructor call (with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">new</code> keyword)
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> is assigned with the newly created object, in this case
the returned object.  Now let’s look at what happens when we call these functions:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
m.x2Arrow(); // this -> mult {x: 50}, return -> 100
m.x2(); // this -> {x2: function(), x2Arrow: function()}, return -> NaN
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Why does the regular function definition return <code class="jarombek-inline-code">NaN</code>?
Remember that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> is defined as the return object of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">mult()</code>, which contains two properties:
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">x2</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x2Arrow</code>.
Notice there is no <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code> property defined, so
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this.x</code> equals
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">undefined</code>.  Multiplying a number by
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">undefined</code> in JavaScript equals
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">NaN</code>.
</p>
<p>
But why does the arrow function maintain the correct <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this.x</code>
value and return the intended result?  Because of lexical <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>
, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> reference in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
x2Arrow</code> is the value that was held by <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in the
function definitions scope (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this.x = 50</code>).
Lexical scoped <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> values cannot be changed even when called
later in the code in different scopes.  Let’s put this claim to the test by trying to
explicitly set <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
m.x2Arrow.call({x: 5}); // this -> mult {x: 50}, return -> 100
m.x2.call({x: 5}); // this => {x: 5}, return -> 10
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As you can see the arrow function was not effected by our explicit
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> binding!  Very cool (and a bit confusing).  Some claim
that arrow functions fix some of JavaScript’s flaws<sup>1</sup> (in this case confusing
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> rules).  Others say it breaks expected behavior in the
language<sup>2</sup>.  I think if you aren’t using <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in
your code arrow functions can be a great way to increase readability.  Just be careful if the code gets
in the hands of developers who aren’t aware of JavaScript’s quirks!

In a previous posts I looked at Promises and Generators in JavaScript.  I mentioned that
these two new ES6 features can be especially powerful when combined.  I do think that Promises on
their own are very useful, however I am not yet sold on Generators.  Now we can
see how Generators can potentially be used in production level code.
</p>
<p>
When combining Promises and Generators, we can create a function that handles asynchronous tasks
(let us call it <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code>).  This function takes one parameter -
a generator function.  Each <code class="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> statement in the generator
passes a promise, which when resolved with a value calls the generators iterator.  Therefore each
asynchronous task in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function moves
on to the next task in sequential order when the promise is completed.  Let's look at some pseudocode:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function async(generator) {
    var iterator = generator();
    await(iterator.next())

    function await(promise) {
        promise.then(function() {
            await(iterator.next());
        })
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code lacks all the error handling and other technicalities that would be seen in production code,
but displays the basic ideas of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function.  Now lets
look at some pseudocode of how <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async()</code> would be called using
some made up functions that execute HTTP GET calls.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
async(function *tasks() {
    yield httpGet("www.example.com/search/1");
    yield httpGet("www.example.com/search/2");
    yield httpGet("www.example.com/search/3");
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With our reusable <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function, this is now how simple our
asynchronous code can be!  Even better, it is laid out in a synchronous manner, no promises or dreaded
callbacks to deal with!  All of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Promise</code> code is extracted out.
So why am I only showing pseudocode and not the real thing?  This is because in ECMAScript 2017 (or following
the old naming convention ES8) this pattern has gotten even easier with a standardized
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function<sup>1</sup> which is created using the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">await</code> keywords.
</p>
<p>
In my discovery on promises I created a google search API for cat posts.  I am going to use this example
again except this time using an ES2017 <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function.  I will
use Node 9 so that I won't have to transpile my code with Babel.  One thing that Node 9
(the newest version of Node.js as of November 2017) does not currently support is ES6 modules by default, so
I have to use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">--experimental-modules</code> flag when running my code
to enable them<sup>2</sup>.  I also have to use the .mjs extension for my JavaScript
files so Node.js knows that they are modules.  These files are hilariously referred to as Micheal Jackson
Scripts.  Hopefully the .mjs files are just for the experimental version and not here to stay - I would miss
those .js files (and it doesn't seem like an elegant solution)!
</p>
<p>
Now let's get to the code.  Our first stop is the meowHttp module which creates a promise for our google
search<sup>3</sup>.  This module will be imported into the main JavaScript file and used in the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import {default as https} from 'https';

export function search(query = 'cat') {

const url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=AIzaSyA2QIPJoGYMx_DuQH6wDqNG3AHXG7bcb94' +
            '&cx=005720647135116730303:chkg-pnyocg&q=' + query + '&prettyPrint=false';

return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {

    https.get(url, res => {
        res.setEncoding('utf-8');
        let response = '';

        res.on('data', data => {
            response += data;
        });

        res.on('end', () => {
            resolve(JSON.parse(response));
        });
        });
    });
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Let's put this module to work with our ES2017 <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import * as http from './meowHttp';

(async function search() {
    let catResult = await http.search();
    print(catResult);

    let meowResult = await http.search('meow');
    print(meowResult);
})();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you compare this code with the previous Promise and Generator code you can see that the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">await</code>
keywords and simply syntactic sugar for our <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async()</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">await()</code> functions.  Now this is a truly elegant solution
that allows asynchronous code to be written in an easy to understand synchronous manner.  All of the
synchronous code is separated out in our imported modules <code class="jarombek-inline-code">search()</code>
function.  In this code the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">print()</code> function displays the names
of the articles from the API, and the result of running the code is as follows:

<p>
Now you can see how powerful the ES2017 <code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function is!
Although you don't actually work with the details of combined Promises
and Generators in ES2017, it is still good to know what is going on behind the scenes!  You can

Unsecured AWS S3 buckets have been a major source of data leaks in the Software Engineering industry for years.  Enter
a Google search for <a href="https://bit.ly/3ECsVSc">"S3 bucket public data leak"</a> and you will find countless
examples of hackers leaking data from Amazon S3.
</p>
<p>
The biggest reason why S3 data leaks are so common is that objects (files) in S3 buckets are public over HTTP by
default.  This means that unless an engineer explicitly restricts access to the S3 bucket, its contents are public for
anyone in the world to view.  For engineers new to AWS and the S3 service, the mistake of leaving S3 buckets public is
very common.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, AWS has provided more ways to secure S3 buckets and provide explicit warnings to users if S3 buckets
are not properly protected.  AWS accounts can even have account-wide restrictions which prevent the creation of public
buckets.

<p>
In my AWS account, most of the S3 buckets have restrictions for who can access their contents.  However, just a week
ago, some buckets in my account were public, such as those used for static websites or those containing assets such as
images and fonts for my websites.  While there isn’t much danger in keeping these buckets public - they don’t contain
any sensitive data - it is still best practice to keep them private.  This article discusses how to restrict access to
these S3 buckets, while still keeping their contents publicly available via HTTP.  All the infrastructure changes
needed to restrict S3 access are written using Terraform.

In the AWS Console, if an S3 bucket is publicly accessible, a warning icon is displayed.

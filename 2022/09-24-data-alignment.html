Data alignment in operating systems is something I’ve been aware of throughout my young career, mostly thanks to my
love for reading software engineering books.  However, it’s not a concept that I’ve explored in depth.  In this
article, I’ll discuss the basics of data alignment and how it applies to programming languages like Go.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is Data Alignment">What is Data Alignment?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Data alignment feels like an intimidating topic since alignments differ depending on machine architectures and
operating systems.  However, data alignment is conceptually equivalent across these different architectures.
High-level programming languages like Go abstract away much of the complexity as well, making data alignment
something an application engineer rarely needs to worry about.
</p>
<Definition word="Data Alignment">
<p>
Data alignment refers to how data is arranged in computer memory.  Computer memory is a device used to store data for
immediate use.  Computer memory most likely refers to main memory, which in modern computers is Random Access Memory
(RAM)<sup>1</sup>.  CPUs perform optimally when data in memory is properly aligned<sup>2,3</sup>.  In fact, many
processors have requirements that force data in memory to be properly aligned, or so-called <strong>naturally aligned</strong>
<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<p>
For example, in a processor with a 32-bit architecture (a CPU with a 4 byte word size), data is naturally aligned if it
 exists at a location in memory that is a multiple of 32<sup>5,6</sup>.  For example, if an integer is stored at the 96th bit in
memory within a 32-bit architecture, it is properly aligned because <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
96 / 32 == 3</code>.  Similarly, in a processor with a 64-bit architecture (a CPU with an 8 byte word size), data is
naturally aligned if it exists at a location in memory that is a multiple of 64.
</p>
</Definition>
<Definition word="Naturally Aligned">
Data is considered naturally aligned when it is stored at a memory address that is a multiple of its size.  With
 regards to processors, word size is used to determine natural data alignment.  However, in regards to programming
language variables, the size of a data type is often used to determine the alignment of data.  For example, in Go, a
16-bit integer (of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">int16</code>) should be aligned in memory at a location
that is a multiple of 16 to be naturally aligned.
</Definition>
<p>
In languages with manual memory management, for example, C and C++, functions to allocate memory such as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">malloc()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">calloc()</code> are
guaranteed to properly align the memory space that they return<sup>4</sup>.  Manual memory management is when
memory needs to be explicitly managed by a programmer throughout its lifecycle, from creation to garbage
collection<sup>7</sup>.  Since Go is a programming language with automatic memory management (it automatically
allocates memory using <code className="jarombek-inline-code">new()</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
make()</code> and automatically garbage collects unused memory), instances where data alignment is top of mind for engineers are
infrequent.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Data Alignment in Go">Data Alignment in Go</SectionTitle>
<p>
Go has three functions for finding the size and alignment of data: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
unsafe.Sizeof()</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Alignof()</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Offsetof()</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
unsafe.Sizeof()</code> returns the size of a variable's data type and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
unsafe.Alignof()</code> returns the proper alignment of a variable’s data type.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
unsafe.Offsetof()</code> is used specifically for struct fields to determine the offset of a field's memory location
within a struct.
</p>
<p>
The value returned by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Sizeof()</code> can be machine dependent.  For
types such as booleans, the return value is always <strong>1</strong>, representing one byte<sup>8</sup>.  However, for
other data types, such as integers, strings, arrays, etc., the return value is dependent on the word size of a
computer's CPU architecture.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
// Bool
// Return value: 1
unsafe.Sizeof(false)

// int (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 8
unsafe.Sizeof(1)

// string (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 16
unsafe.Sizeof("Andy")

// []T (array) (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 24
unsafe.Sizeof([]string{})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
On a 64-bit architecture, the word size is 8 bytes.  That means that integers, strings, and arrays have sizes of 1
word, 2 words, and 3 words, respectively.  Sizes represent the fixed size of a data type, so the return value of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Sizeof()</code> is consistent no matter how long a string is or how many
elements an array contains.  For basic types like <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bool</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">int</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Alignof()</code>
returns the same value as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Sizeof()</code>.  For more complex types like
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">string</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">[]T</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Alignof()</code> returns the CPU word size in bytes.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
// Bool
// Return value: 1
unsafe.Alignof(false)

// int (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 8
unsafe.Alignof(1)

// string (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 8
unsafe.Alignof("Andy")

// []T (array) (on a 64-bit processor)
// Return value: 8
unsafe.Alignof([]string{})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Alignof()</code> returns the necessary data alignment for its argument’s
type.  Therefore, it makes sense that larger types return the word size of the computer processor, which is
equal to the natural alignment in memory.
</p>
<p>
Things get a bit more interesting for data types whose size is less than the word size of a computer’s architecture.
Data types such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bool</code>, whose size is one byte, still must be naturally
aligned in memory (its location in memory must be a multiple of the word size, such as 8-bytes on a 64-bit
architecture).  To achieve this, padding is added after the data type in memory to keep it aligned<sup>9</sup>.  In
the case of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bool</code> on a 64-bit machine, one byte is used to store the data
and the next seven bytes are padding.
</p>
<p>
If a boolean actually takes up a full word size in memory, why do
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Sizeof()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
unsafe.Alignof()</code> return <code className="jarombek-inline-code">1</code>?  The answer is because within a struct, it is
possible to "pack" data such that multiple pieces of data are stored within a single word size worth of
memory<sup>10</sup>.  Data packing is commonly used to save space in a data structure.  The side effect of data
structure packing is the order in which struct fields are defined can alter the amount of memory a struct requires.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at an example.  The following two structs appear to be equivalent, since they have the same fields defined
in a different order.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
type Sample1 struct {
	a bool
	b bool
	c float64
}

type Sample2 struct {
	a bool
	c float64
	b bool
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
However, calling <code className="jarombek-inline-code">unsafe.Sizeof()</code> on these structs
reveals their sizes are different in memory.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
one := Sample1{a: true, b: true, c: 1.0}
two := Sample2{a: true, b: true, c: 1.0}

// Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 16
unsafe.Sizeof(one)

// Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 24
unsafe.Sizeof(two)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code> creates a struct the size of two words (16 bytes),
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code> creates a struct the size of three words (24 bytes).  This is the
result of extra padding needed in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code> due to the field order in the
struct definition.
</p>
<p>
The first two fields in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
a</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code>, are type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
bool</code>.  Since the size and alignment of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bool</code> is one, both
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code> can be packed
together into a single word in memory.  This means the first eight bytes of memory for a struct of type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code> consists of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code> in the first two bytes followed by six bytes of padding.  The third
field in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">c</code>, is a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">float64</code>, which takes up a full eight bytes on a 64-bit machine.  In
total, the struct takes up 16 bytes (2 words).
</p>
<p>
Next, let's take the case of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code>.  The first field in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code>, is a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bool</code> that is placed in the first byte of memory for the struct.  Since
the second field is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">c</code>, a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
float64</code> that takes up a full eight bytes, seven bytes of padding are added after
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code>.  The third field is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code>,
which takes up one byte followed by another seven bytes of padding.  In total, the struct takes up 24 bytes (3 words).
</p>
<p>
Luckily for application engineers, outside of field packing in structs, data alignment in memory is not a concern that
arises when writing Go programs.  The code examples I showed above can be viewed in more detail in my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">go-programming</a> repository, specifically within
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.0/low-level-programming/sizeof_test.go">sizeof_test.go</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.0/low-level-programming/alignment_offset_test.go">

<SectionTitle title="Data Alignment in C and C++">Data Alignment in C and C++</SectionTitle>
<p>
As I mentioned previously, C and C++ are programming languages with manual memory management, and standard library
functions such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">malloc()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
calloc()</code> are guaranteed to properly align allocated memory.  Similar to Go, structs are a common instance where data
alignment impacts application code.  The struct example I showed in Go with two structs,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code>, is
implemented in C and C++ below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
#include &lt;stdbool.h>
#include &lt;assert.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>

struct Sample1 {
    bool a;
    bool b;
    double c;
};

struct Sample2 {
    bool a;
    double c;
    bool b;
};

int main() {
    struct Sample1 first = {true, false, 1.0};
    struct Sample2 second = {true, 1.0, false};

	// Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 16
	sizeof(first);

	// Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 24
	sizeof(second);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
#include &lt;cassert>
#include &lt;iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Sample1 {
    bool a;
    bool b;
    double c;
};

struct Sample2 {
    bool a;
    double c;
    bool b;
};

int main() {
    auto first = Sample1{true, false, 1.0};
    auto second = Sample2{true, 1.0, false};

    // Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 16
    sizeof(first);

    // Return value (on a 64-bit processor): 24
    sizeof(second);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Just like Go, an instance of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample1</code> takes up two word sizes of memory
while <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Sample2</code> takes up three word sizes of memory.  These code samples
are available in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/cpp-c-programming">cpp-c-programming</a> repository, within
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/cpp-c-programming/blob/main/c/data-alignment/data_alignment.c">data_alignment.c</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/cpp-c-programming/blob/main/cpp/data-alignment/data_alignment.cpp">
data_alignment.cpp</a> files, respectively.

While writing system programs, specifically in Linux, an engineer has a bit more control over how allocated memory is
aligned.  POSIX defines a function <code className="jarombek-inline-code">posix_memalign()</code> which allocates
memory and aligns it at a multiple of its second argument<sup>11,12</sup>.  The first argument of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">posix_memalign()</code> is a pointer that will point to the allocated memory
and the third (and final) argument is the number of bytes to allocate in memory.  The example below allocates 1024
bytes of memory and aligns it at a multiple of eight.  It frees the newly allocated memory before using it by invoking
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">free(buf)</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
char *buf;

// Allocate 1024 bytes of memory aligned at a multiple of 8.
int ret = posix_memalign(&buf, 8, 1024);

if (ret) {
	perror("posix_memalign");
	return -1;
}

free(buf);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although I aligned the allocated memory on the 64-bit architecture page size (8 bytes) above, any value that is a
multiple of two and a multiple of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">sizeof(void *)</code> can be used.  On a
64-bit architecture, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">sizeof(void *)</code> likely returns
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">8</code> (the page size).  The full code example is available in an
 <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/system-programming-prototypes/blob/main/memory_management/alignment.c">
alignment.c</a> file and is based on my reading of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/
linux-system-programming/9781449341527/">Linux System Programming</a> by Robert Love.

Although data alignment may not be top of mind for application engineers, it is important to understand how it works and
its impact on high-level programming languages.  In general, knowing low-level operating system functionality helps
engineers write better programs in high-level languages, just as knowing data structures and algorithms helps write
faster and less memory intensive code.  All the code discussed in this article is available in my

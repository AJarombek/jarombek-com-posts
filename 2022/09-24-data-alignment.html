Data alignment in operating systems is something I’ve been aware of throughout my young career, mostly thanks to my
love for reading software engineering books.  However, it’s not a concept that I’ve explored in depth.  In this
article, I’ll discuss the basics of data alignment and how it applies to languages like Go.

Data alignment feels like an intimidating topic since alignments differ depending on machine architectures and
operating systems.  However, data alignment is conceptually equivalent across these different architectures.
High-level programming languages like Go abstract away much of the complexity as well, making memory alignment
something an application engineer rarely needs to worry about.

Data alignment refers to how data is arranged in computer memory.  Computer memory is the device used to store data for
immediate use, and most likely refers to main memory;  which in modern computers is Random Access Memory
(RAM)<sup>1</sup>.  CPUs perform optimally when data in memory is properly aligned<sup>2,3</sup>.  In fact, many
processors have requirements that data in memory is properly aligned, or so-called <strong>naturally aligned</strong>
<sup>4</sup>.

For example, in a processor with a 32-bit architecture (a CPU with a 4 byte word size), data is naturally aligned if it
is located at a location in memory that is a multiple of 32<sup>5,6</sup>.  If an integer is stored at the 96th bit in
memory within a 32-bit architecture, it is properly aligned because <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
96 / 32 == 3</code>.  Similarly, in a processor with a 64-bit architecture (a CPU with an 8 byte word size), data is
naturally aligned if it is located at a location in memory that is a multiple of 64.

Data is considered naturally aligned when it is stored at a memory address that is a multiple of its size.  When
referring to processors, the word size is used to determine the alignment of data.  However, in regards to programming
language variables, the size of the data type is often used to determine the alignment of data.  For example, in Go, a
16-bit integer (of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">int16</code>) should be aligned in memory at a location
that is a multiple of 16 to be naturally aligned.

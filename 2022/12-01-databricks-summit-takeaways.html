Databricks is a data warehouse and data lake platform designed around Apache Spark.  I use Databricks extensively at
work, but also use Databricks and Apache Spark in personal applications.  This summer, I attended my first software
engineering conference, the <a href="https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/">Databricks Data+AI Summit</a> in San
Francisco.  The conference was a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in the data engineering industry.

At the start, the Databricks Data+AI Summit felt more like a concert than a software engineering conference.  However,
by the end, after taking part in many breakout sessions, I had some clear takeaways about the future of the Databricks
platform and the Data Science and AI industry at large.

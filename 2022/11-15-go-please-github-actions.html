<p>
During software development, it's important to test logic and perform static code analysis to ensure programs meet
certain standards.  Build tools and CI/CD platforms help developers automate these tasks.  There are many different
build tools, such as Make, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Bazel&page=1">Bazel</a>,
 and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Please&page=1">Please</a>, along with many CI/CD platforms, such as
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Jenkins&page=1">Jenkins</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=TravisCI&page=1">TravisCI</a>,
 and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=GitHub%20Actions&page=1">GitHub Actions</a> (to name a few). Due to a
 wide variety of choices, it can be overwhelming for engineers to pick the best option for their codebase.
</p>
<p>
Although I've experimented a bit with TravisCI in the past, most of my CI/CD work up until now has been on Jenkins.
Outside of language or platform specific build tools (such as CMake or Webpack), I haven't used many language-agnostic
build tools in my code up to this point.  While designing my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">
go-programming</a> repository, which contains Go programming language code samples, I decided to work with a
new build tool and CI/CD platform.
</p>
<p>
For the build tool, I decided to use <a href="https://please.build/">Please Build</a>, a language agnostic build platform
 derived from Google's internal Blaze build tool, which was ported to the open source community as Bazel<sup>1</sup>.  For the
 CI/CD platform, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, which is built into
GitHub.  In this article, I'll discuss the basics of Please Build and GitHub Actions, along with how I integrated both
into my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">go-programming</a> repository.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Repository Overview">Repository Overview</SectionTitle>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">go-programming</a> repository consists of many subdirectories
containing Go code.  This Go code contains unit tests that I ensure are successful and libraries that I build and compile
into machine specific binaries.  For example, the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/
goroutines">goroutines</a> subdirectory contains unit tests, such as <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/goroutines/basics_test.go">basics_test.go</a>, along with libraries, such as
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/goroutines/goroutine_example/goroutine_example.go">
goroutine_example.go</a>.
</p>
<p>
I use the GoLand IDE by Jetbrains for Go development.  One of the great features of Jetbrains IDEs, GoLand included, are
 run configurations.  Run configurations enable an easy way to run or test Go code through the GoLand UI<sup>2</sup>.
Run configurations can optionally run on a Docker container, and configurations can be saved and committed to a
repository in XML files.
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a> repository, run
configurations are stored in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/.run">.run</a>
directory.  These run configurations execute on Docker containers, which are defined in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/base">base</a> directory.  Currently, all my run
configurations execute on docker containers derived from a base <strong>Dockerfile</strong>, which is specified in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/base/Dockerfile">base/Dockerfile</a>, with the
following setup.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Dockerfile">
FROM golang:1.18.3-alpine3.16

RUN apk add gcc libc-dev linux-headers

RUN curl https://get.please.build > please.sh && \
    bash ./please.sh

ENV PATH="${PATH}:/root/.please/bin"

STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Most importantly, the base Dockerfile installs Please Build from the URL <strong>
https://get.please.build</strong> and appends its installation directory onto the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
PATH</code> environment variable.  Go is installed and configured in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">golang</code>
image, which is specified as the base image using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
FROM golang:1.18.3-alpine3.16</code> command.
</p>
<p>
Each subdirectory in the repository has its own Dockerfile, using <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/
blob/v1.1.2/base/Dockerfile">base/Dockerfile</a> as its base image. Subdirectory Dockerfiles contain commands
needed to execute the code within the subdirectory.  For example, the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/goroutines">goroutines</a> subdirectory contains the following <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/goroutines/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a>
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Dockerfile">
FROM ajarombek/go-alpine-linux-programming:latest

WORKDIR src
COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["go", "test", "-v", "."]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This Dockerfile uses the base image <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ajarombek/go-alpine-linux-programming:latest
</code>, which is available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ajarombek/go-alpine-linux-programming">
DockerHub</a>.  It copies files from my repository onto the containers filesystem and runs the command
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go test -v .</code>, which executes all the Go tests.
</p>
<p>
This Dockerfile is also used in a run configuration for the repository.  GoLand run configurations are XML files, and
in my repository they specify a docker container to run.  For the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/goroutines">goroutines</a> subdirectory, I created a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/.run/goroutines.run.xml">goroutines.run.xml</a> run
configuration which starts a Docker container.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="XML">
&lt;component name="ProjectRunConfigurationManager">
    &lt;configuration default="false" name="goroutines" type="docker-deploy" factoryName="dockerfile" server-name="Docker">
        &lt;deployment type="dockerfile">
            &lt;settings>
                &lt;option name="containerName" value="go_programming_goroutines" />
                &lt;option name="sourceFilePath" value="goroutines/Dockerfile" />
            &lt;/settings>
        &lt;/deployment>
        &lt;method v="2" />
    &lt;/configuration>
&lt;/component>
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This run configuration specifies the creation of a Docker image named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
go_programming_goroutines</code> created using the Dockerfile <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
goroutines/Dockerfile</code>. Putting all the pieces together, the following image shows what it looks like to trigger
the run configuration and view its console log.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="11-15-22-goland-run-config.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
Run configurations are great for manually executing tests or running code.  However, for CI/CD purposes, operations
like executing tests, compiling code, and packaging binaries should be automated.  This is where Please Build and
GitHub Actions can help.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Please Build Setup">Please Build Setup</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Please Build">
Please Build is a language agnostic build system derived from Bazel and Blaze, which are open source and proprietary
build systems originating at Google.  Like Bazel and Blaze, Please Build uses the Starlark programming language for its
build files.  Build files, commonly named <strong>BUILD</strong>, contain build targets, which are units of deployable
code<sup>3</sup>.  Build targets are written using rules, which appear as Python functions.  Rules are configurable
using arguments and they determine what occurs when a build target is run.  Builds are run in isolation from
application source code; they are given a separate <strong>plz-out</strong> directory to run it.  Build results are
also cached, which makes subsequent builds on unchanged code very fast.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Starlark Programming Language">
Starlark is a programming language that is syntactically similar to and inspired by Python<sup>4</sup>.  Starlark is
used in <strong>BUILD</strong> files for the Blaze and Bazel build tools, along with their derivatives such as Please
Build.  Starlark has different language rules than Python despite its syntactic similarities;  Starlark is neither a
superset or subset of Python.
</Definition>
<p>
When configuring Please Build in a repository, a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz init</code> command is run
from the root of the codebase.  This command creates a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/
v1.1.2/.plzconfig">.plzconfig</a> file in the repository, which configures the execution of Please
commands<sup>5</sup>.  This is how <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/.plzconfig">
.plzconfig</a> appears in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a>
repository.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TOML">
[please]
version = 16.22.1

[build]
PassEnv = PATH
path = $PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

[buildenv]
test-env = plz
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/.plzconfig">.plzconfig</a> lists out different build
options to use in the repository<sup>6</sup>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">version = 16.22.1</code> sets the
version of Please Build to use while performing builds.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PassEnv = PATH</code>
takes the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PATH</code> environment variable and makes it accessible while Please
Build rules are executed.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">path = $PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</code>
 takes this <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PATH</code> environment variable and appends
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</code> to it.  Finally,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">test-env = plz</code> creates a new environment variable named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">TEST_ENV</code> and assigns it a value of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
plz</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TEST_ENV</code> is accessible while running Please Build commands.
These are just a few of the configuration options available with Please Build; a full list of options are available in
the <a href="https://please.build/config.html">Please Build documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
As previously mentioned, Please Build consists of <strong>BUILD</strong> files written in Starlark.  In my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a> repository, the root directory
contains a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/BUILD">BUILD</a> file with the following
contents.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Starlark">
package(default_visibility = ["PUBLIC"])

go_toolchain(
    name = "go_download",
    version = "1.18",
)

go_module(
    name = "testify",
    module = "github.com/stretchr/testify",
    install = ["..."],
    version = "v1.7.0",
    deps = [
        ":go_difflib",
        ":go_yaml",
        ":go_spew",
        ":objx",
    ],
)

go_module(
    name = "go_difflib",
    module = "github.com/pmezard/go-difflib",
    install = ["..."],
    version = "v1.0.0",
    deps = [":go_download"],
)

go_module(
    name = "go_yaml",
    module = "gopkg.in/yaml.v3",
    install = ["..."],
    version = "v3.0.0-20200313102051-9f266ea9e77c",
    deps = [":go_download"],
)

go_module(
    name = "go_spew",
    module = "github.com/davecgh/go-spew",
    install = ["..."],
    version = "v1.1.0",
    deps = [":go_download"],
)

go_module(
    name = "objx",
    module = "github.com/stretchr/objx",
    install = ["..."],
    version = "v0.1.0",
    deps = [":go_download"],
)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
On the first line of code, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">package()</code>, a Please Build built-in function,
sets configuration details for all the ensuing rules<sup>6</sup>.  In my code, it sets the visibility of all the rules
in the file to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PUBLIC</code>, which makes them accessible to all the other rules
in the repository<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The next rule, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_toolchain()</code>, downloads Go for other
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_</code> prefixed rules to use.  Based on my configurations,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_toolchain()</code> downloads version 1.18 of Go.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> argument of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
go_toolchain()</code> defines a unique name for the rule that can be used as a dependency for other rules.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> is considered a common argument, and exists on every rule in Please
Build<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The first <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_module()</code> rule, named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
testify</code>, downloads and installs a Go module that is used by other <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_
</code> prefixed rules.  This Go module contains assertion functions which I use in unit tests.   The full path of the
module is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">github.com/stretchr/testify</code> and the version I install is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">v1.7.0</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">testify</code> depends on
four Go modules itself, which are defined in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">deps</code> argument.  Each
dependency has its own <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_module()</code> rule in the <strong>BUILD</strong>
file. The colon (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">:</code>) before each dependency name informs Please Build that
the dependency is another rule declared in the same package.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, notice how the rules in this <strong>BUILD</strong> file define a dependency tree.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">testify</code> is dependent on four dependencies,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_difflib</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_yaml</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_spew</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">objx</code>, which in turn
are all dependent on <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_download</code>.  This is often the case in Please Build,
where rules build on each other to create a functional build system for an application.
</p>
<p>
Rules in the root <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/BUILD">BUILD</a> file create a
foundation for other rules in the repository.  Let's take a look at another <strong>BUILD</strong> file.
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/unit-testing/BUILD">unit-testing/BUILD</a> defines
rules that run unit tests for a Go program.  The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/
unit-testing">unit-testing</a> directory contains code samples I created based on my learnings from chapter 11 of
<a href="https://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a>.  The <strong>BUILD</strong> file contains two rules.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Starlark">
go_library(
    name = "license_plates",
    srcs = ["license_plates.go"],
    deps = ["//:go_download"],
    labels = ["unit_testing"],
)

go_test(
    name = "test",
    srcs = ["license_plates_test.go"],
    deps = [":license_plates"],
    labels = [
        "unit_testing",
        "test",
    ],
)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
First, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_library()</code> defines a rule, named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">license_plates</code>, that creates a Go library usable by other Go programs.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">license_plates</code> contains a single Go file
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">license_plates.go</code> and is dependent on
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">//:go_download</code>, which downloads and installs Go. The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">//:</code> prefix to the dependency tells Please Build that
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_download</code> is a rule located in the root of the repository.
</p>
<p>
Second, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_test()</code> defines a rule, named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code>, to run Go tests.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code>
contains a single Go file <code className="jarombek-inline-code">license_plates_test.go</code>, which implements
multiple unit test cases, and is dependent on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">license_plates</code> rule.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code> is executed from the command line to verify that all Go tests are
successful. Running a test rule is done with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz test</code> command; in my
scenario, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz test //unit-testing:test -vvv</code> runs my
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code> rule.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">//unit-testing:test
</code> specifies the path and name of the rule to execute, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">-vvv</code> sets
the verbosity level of the console output logs.  Running this command in my repository generates an output similar to
the following log.
</p>
<CodeSnippet>
...
//unit-testing:test 5 tests run in 121ms; 5 passed
    TestValidCountryCode    PASS  0s
    TestInvalidCountryCode  PASS  0s
    TestCollected           PASS  0s
    Collected               PASS  0s
    CountryCode             PASS  0s
1 test target and 5 tests run; 5 passed.
Total time: 15.22s real, 120ms compute.
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Let's look at a similar example in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/reflection">
reflection</a> directory, which analyzes how to use reflection to gain runtime information about types in Go programs.
<strong>reflection</strong> contains zero library files and two unit test files, with the following
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/reflection/BUILD">BUILD</a> configuration.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Starlark">
filegroup(
    name = "test_files",
    srcs = glob(["*.go"]),
)

go_test(
    name = "test",
    srcs = [":test_files"],
    deps = [
        "//:go_download",
        "//:testify",
    ],
    labels = [
        "reflection",
        "test"
    ],
)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Instead of explicitly writing names of Go files in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">srcs</code> argument of
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_test()</code> rule, I use a separate
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">filegroup()</code> rule to collect all the files matching the glob pattern
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">*.go</code>.  In the end, running these tests is the same as it was in the
<strong>unit-testing</strong> directory, with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
plz test //reflection:test -vvv</code> command.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at one more example in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2/goroutines/
channel_example">goroutines/channel_example</a> directory.  <strong>channel_example</strong> contains a single Go
application file, and has the following <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/goroutines/
channel_example/BUILD">BUILD</a> configuration.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Starlark">
go_binary(
    name = "binary",
    srcs = ["channel_example.go"],
    out = "channel_example",
    deps = ["//:go_download"],
    labels = [
        "goroutines",
        "binary",
    ],
)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_binary()</code> rule creates an executable binary file from compiled Go
code.  After Go is installed from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">//:go_download</code> dependency rule, a
single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">channel_example.go</code> file is compiled.  Running a binary rule is
done with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz build</code> command; in my scenario,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz build //goroutines/channel_example:binary -vvv</code> runs the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">binary</code> rule.  Running this command in my repository generates an output
similar to the following log.
</p>
<CodeSnippet>
...
Build finished; total time 12.67s, incrementality 66.7%. Outputs:
//goroutines/channel_example:binary:
  plz-out/bin/goroutines/channel_example/channel_example
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz build</code> command created a binary file within a <strong>plz-out/bin
</strong> directory.  From a command prompt (in my case running Bash), this binary file can be executed.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
./plz-out/bin/goroutines/channel_example/channel_example
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Every subdirectory in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a> repository
contains a <strong>BUILD</strong> file with additional rules in case you want to explore more.  One last thing to
mention is that re-running any Please Build command without altering the source code results in a faster build.  This
is because stages of builds are cached, similar to layers on images being cached in a Dockerfile build.  For example,
the previous <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz build</code> command, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
plz build //goroutines/channel_example:binary -vvv</code>, took 12.67 seconds the first time it ran on my machine.
Running it a second time took just 140 milliseconds.
</p>
<CodeSnippet>
...
Build finished; total time 140ms, incrementality 100.0%. Outputs:
//goroutines/channel_example:binary:
  plz-out/bin/goroutines/channel_example/channel_example
</CodeSnippet>

<Definition word="GitHub Actions">
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform integrated with the GitHub version control hosting service.  GitHub Actions allows
engineers to create workflows that run on virtual machines, containers, or self-hosted infrastructure<sup>10</sup>.
Workflows, written in YAML, contain one or many jobs that run on a schedule or respond to events within a repository,
such as code commits or pull request creation.

This YAML document creates a workflow named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Go Tests</code>.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">on</code> dictionary configures events that trigger the workflow along with
 an additional cron schedule for the workflow to run on.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">on</code> contains four
keys, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">push</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">pull_request</code>,

 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">push</code> triggers the workflow anytime code is pushed
to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">main</code> branch or any branch matching the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">feature/*</code> pattern.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
pull_request</code> triggers the workflow anytime a pull request is made that merges code into the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">main</code>  branch.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">schedule</code> sets
a cron schedule for the workflow to run on, in my case 5:00 AM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Finally,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">workflow_dispatch</code> enables manual triggers of the pipeline from the GitHub
UI or API<sup>11</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">jobs</code> dictionary configures one or many jobs within a workflow.  My
workflow contains a single job named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_tests</code>.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">runs-on</code> key-value pair determines the machine and operating system to run
on, in my case an Ubuntu distribution of Linux (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ubuntu-latest</code>).  On top of
Ubuntu, my job runs in a Docker container, with the image name and tag specified under the
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">container</code> key-value pair.  The value under <code className="jarombek-inline-code">container</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ajarombek/go-alpine-linux-programming:latest</code>, is a Docker image stored on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/
repository/docker/ajarombek/go-alpine-linux-programming">DockerHub</a> and defined in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.2/base/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> in my repository.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">steps</code> is a list of steps within a job.  Steps with a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">run</code> key execute its corresponding value from the shell as a command
line program<sup>12</sup>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> keys give steps a name that are displayed
in the GitHub UI and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">uses</code> keys run actions for a step<sup>13</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Actions are a unit of execution within GitHub Actions.  They are programs, often written in JavaScript, that perform
commonly repeated tasks<sup>14</sup>.  In my case, I use a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
actions/checkout@v3</code> action, which is <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">maintained by GitHub</a>.
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">actions/checkout@v3</code> is used to checkout a GitHub repository.
</p>
<p>
As a whole, my <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Go Tests</code> workflow runs on a custom Docker container,
performs a checkout of my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a>
repository, and runs a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz test //... -i test -vvv</code> command, which
executes all Go tests in my code.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">-i test</code> flag in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">plz test</code> command runs every Please Build rule that has a label of value
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code>.
</p>
<p>
Results of GitHub actions are viewable in repositories on GitHub.  One way to view actions is to click on the "Actions"
tab at the top of a repository page.

In the list of workflow results under the "Actions" tab, clicking on one of them navigates to the following page, which
 gives an overview of the workflow run and the results of individual jobs.

My "Go Tests" workflow contains a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go_tests</code> job, and clicking on it
displays the execution logs.

GitHub Actions send an email when workflows fail, which is a great way to stay alerted on the status of a codebase.  I
only demonstrated the basics of GitHub Actions in this article, and there is a lot more for me to learn, but GitHub Actions is a very
promising CI/CD framework that I intend to use extensively in the future.

Combining the "Please Build" build system and GitHub Actions CI/CD platform was a great way to test Go code in
both my development environment and on GitHub's hosted platform.  I plan to expand my usage of both technologies into
other projects and learn more advanced features.  All the code discussed in this article is available in my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.2">go-programming</a> repository on GitHub.

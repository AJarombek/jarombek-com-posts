During software development, it’s important to test logic and perform static code analysis to ensure programs meet
certain standards.  Build tools and CI/CD platforms help developers automate these tasks.  There are so many different
build tools, such as Make, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Bazel&page=1">Bazel</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Please&page=1">Please</a>, and CI/CD platforms, such as
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Jenkins&page=1">Jenkins</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=TravisCI&page=1">TravisCI</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=GitHub%20Actions&page=1">GitHub Actions</a> (to name a few), that it can
become overwhelming for engineers to pick the best option for their codebase.
</p>
<p>
Although I’ve experimented a bit with TravisCI in the past, most of my CI/CD work up until now has been on Jenkins.
Outside of language or platform specific build tools (such as CMake or Webpack), I haven’t used many language-agnostic
build tools in my code to this point.  While designing my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">
go-programming</a> repository, a codebase containing Go programming language sample programs, I decided to work with a
new build tool and CI/CD platform.
</p>
<p>
For a build tool, I decided to use <a href="https://please.build/">Please Build</a>, a language agnostic build platform
based on Google’s internal Blaze build tool, which was ported to the open source community as Bazel<sup>1</sup>.  For a
CI/CD platform, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, which is built-in to
GitHub.  In this article, I’ll discuss the basics of Please Build and GitHub Actions, along with how I integrated both
into my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">go-programming</a> repository.

The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming">go-programming</a> repository consists of many subdirectories
containing Go code.  This Go code contains tests that I ensure are successful and libraries that I build and compile
into machine specific binaries.  For example, the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/tree/v1.1.0/
goroutines">goroutines</a> subdirectory contains test code, such as <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
go-programming/blob/v1.1.0/goroutines/basics_test.go">basics_test.go</a>, along with libraries, such as
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/v1.1.0/goroutines/goroutine_example/goroutine_example.go">
goroutine_example.go</a>.

I use the GoLand IDE by Jetbrains for Go development.  One of the great features of Jetbrains IDEs, GoLand included, is
run configurations.  Run configurations enable an easy way to run or test Go code through the GoLand UI<sup>2</sup>.
Run configurations can optionally run on a Docker container, and configurations can be saved and committed to a
repository in XML files.

This is part of a series of articles on SaintsXCTF Version 2.0. The first article in the series provides an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">overview of the application</a>.  You
<strong>DO NOT</strong> need to read prior articles in the series to fully understand this article.

In the first version of my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">SaintsXCTF application</a>, one underdeveloped aspect of
the technology stack was the infrastructure around the MySQL database.  The only way to access the production database
was to create a Bastion host and interact with it via the command line.  This bastion host was a server that was only
accessible from my IP address and could only interact with my MySQL database.  All other network ports were closed.
</p>
<p>
While this was an okay start, I really wanted a user interface to interact with the MySQL database with similar
functionality to a local MySQL IDE, such as DataGrip.  After researching different options, I decided to use phpMyAdmin,
a MySQL administrative client that can be run on a web server.  My approach is to run phpMyAdmin on a container within
a Kubernetes deployment.  This way, I can spin the phpMyAdmin client up and down quickly depending on my needs.
</p>
<p>
In this article, Iâ€™ll give an overview of phpMyAdmin and share the infrastructure needed to create it.

phpMyAdmin is a web application that allows administrators to view MySQL databases, tables, and more.  Administrators
can also execute queries and other SQL statements in the web application UI.  In many ways, phpMyAdmin operates the same
as a desktop SQL IDE.
</p>
<p>
When loading the webpage for phpMyAdmin, users are presented with the following screen.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="3-27-22-phpmyadmin.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
From here, database connection details are entered.  If phpMyAdmin is successful in connecting to the database, the
following webpage is displayed.

<p>
Multiple options are presented on this page, including viewing schemas within the database or writing SQL statements.
SQL statements can be entered into a text box and executed, with results shown in the UI.

All the infrastructure for the phpMyAdmin database client is written as code using Terraform.  The phpMyAdmin server is
a container running within a Kubernetes cluster.  My Kubernetes cluster is hosted using AWS EKS, with the cluster
infrastructure existing in an <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/global-aws-infrastructure/tree/master/eks">eks</a>
module within my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/global-aws-infrastructure">global-aws-infrastructure</a>
repository.
</p>
<p>
My phpMyAdmin server infrastructure has its own Terraform module named <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/database-client">database-client</a>, which exists within my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  This
diagram shows all the components of the infrastructure.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="3-27-22-infra-diagram.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
Most of the infrastructure code exists within a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/
master/database-client/main.tf">main.tf</a> file.  The most important resource for the web server, the Kubernetes
Deployment object, has the following setup.

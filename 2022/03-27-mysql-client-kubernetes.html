This is part of a series of articles on SaintsXCTF Version 2.0. The first article in the series provides an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">overview of the application</a>.  You
<strong>DO NOT</strong> need to read prior articles in the series to fully understand this article.

<p>
In the first version of my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">SaintsXCTF application</a>, one underdeveloped aspect of
the technology stack was the infrastructure around the MySQL database.  The only way to access the production database
was to create a Bastion host and interact with it via the command line.  This bastion host was a server that was only
accessible from my IP address and could only interact with my MySQL database.  All other network ports were closed.
</p>
<p>
While this was an okay start, I really wanted a user interface to interact with the MySQL database with similar
functionality to a local MySQL IDE, such as DataGrip.  After researching different options, I decided to use phpMyAdmin,
a MySQL administrative client that can be run on a web server.  My approach is to run phpMyAdmin on a container within
a Kubernetes deployment.  This way, I can spin the phpMyAdmin client up and down quickly depending on my needs.
</p>
<p>
In this article, Iâ€™ll give an overview of phpMyAdmin and share the infrastructure needed to create it.

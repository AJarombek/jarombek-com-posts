Over the last six months, I’ve been using Apache Airflow extensively at work.  Airflow is a platform and framework for
building and automating data pipelines<sup>1</sup>.  Airflow data pipelines are written in Python and interoperate with
many different technologies, such as databases, cloud platforms, containers, and more.  Often, Airflow is used in
realms of data analytics and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
While Airflow data pipelines are written in Python, the software they automate and schedule do not need to be Python
related.  However, the fact that Python is used makes Airflow data pipelines highly configurable and customizable.
Since Python is very popular and simpler to learn compared to other languages, most engineers will be able to work with
Airflow easily.
</p>
<p>
There are three main objectives to this article: introducing the basic concepts of Airflow, creating an Airflow
development environment, and exploring basic Airflow pipelines.  The code discussed in this article is available on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/master/Airflow">GitHub</a>.

<Definition word="Airflow">
Airflow is a platform and framework for building, automating, and scheduling data pipelines<sup>2</sup>.  Data
pipelines in Airflow are known as workflows or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).  Airflow DAGs are configured as code
using Python, and can be run ad hoc or on a schedule.  The Airflow platform creates an execution and scheduling
environment for DAGs, viewable from a web interface.
</Definition>
<p>
The main objective of Airflow is to run DAGs either manually or based on a schedule.
</p>
<Definition word="Airflow DAG">
A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), also referred to as a data pipeline or workflow, is a schedulable graph of tasks
which is run based on a schedule.  Since DAGs are acyclic, the graph of tasks in a DAG can’t contain any cycles, but
can branch and converge as needed.  Airflow DAGs are written and configured in Python.  DAGs contain information such
as a list of tasks, the execution order (graph) of the tasks, an execution schedule, and additional metadata.
</Definition>
<p>
An image of an Airflow DAG, as seen from the Airflow UI, is shown below.

<Definition word="Airflow Task">
In Airflow, tasks are the smallest unit of execution<sup>3</sup>.  Tasks are units within a DAG, with upstream and
downstream dependencies within the graph.  Tasks can perform simple operations such as running a Python function or
Bash script, or more complex operations like running a Docker container.  There are many different types of tasks,
which are created using Airflow Operators.  Operators are templates for building tasks; for example, a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PythonOperator</code> is used to create a task that runs a Python
function<sup>4</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
The Airflow platform consists of multiple components; most importantly, Airflow consists of a web server, scheduler,
and metastore.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Airflow Components">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Web Server
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
In Airflow, the web server is the UI in which users can view and trigger DAGs. The web server is also helpful for
viewing DAG run results and debug DAGs by looking through execution logs.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Scheduler
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The Airflow scheduler is a constantly running program that monitors all DAGs in the Airflow environment<sup>5</sup>.
Python DAG files exist in a specific directory in the Airflow environment, and the scheduler is responsible for parsing
these DAG files and storing information about them within the Airflow metastore.  The scheduler also checks if DAGs and
tasks within DAGs are eligible for execution.  When tasks are eligible for execution, the scheduler places them in a
queued state, and then executes them<sup>6</sup>.  In many ways, the scheduler is the heart of the Airflow platform.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Metastore
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The Airflow metastore holds metadata about an Airflow environment, including configuration details and DAG information.
Everything that happens within the Airflow environment also exists in the metastore, including DAG run information.
The metastore is a relational database, commonly MySQL or PostgreSQL.  <a href="https://www.astronomer.io/guides/
airflow-database">This article</a> provides a good high-level overview of the data stored in the metastore.

<p>
After signing into the Airflow UI, the initial view displays all the DAGs in the Airflow environment.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="1-17-22-airflow-home.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
The list of DAGs displays basic information about each DAG, such as their execution schedules, and the results of
recent runs.  It also gives options to toggle DAGs on and off (the switch to the left of the DAG name) and run DAGs
(the play button in the "Actions" column).  Clicking on a DAG shows the following view:
</p>
<InlineImage filename="1-17-22-airflow-graph-view.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
Airflow DAGs have multiple views; the view shown above is called the Graph view.  The Graph view shows the DAG and the
result of the previous run.  In this case, both tasks ran successfully, as denoted by both tasks being outlined in
green.  Hovering over a task supplies more information about it, and clicking on the task provides options such as
viewing the logs or re-running the task.

Clicking on the "Log" button displays the logs for the task run, which is very useful for debugging.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="1-17-22-airflow-log-view.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">

<p>
Another useful page is the DAGs tree view.  This page shows the results of all the prior DAG runs.  In the image below,
the last two runs of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">hello_world</code> DAG are shown, both of which were
successful.
</p>

Airflow provides many ways to view DAGs and environment configurations, but the pages shown above are the ones I’ve
found most useful these past six months.

<SectionTitle title="Airflow Development Environment">Airflow Development Environment</SectionTitle>
<p>
While it is possible to run Airflow on the host machine of your development environment, a more elegant approach is to
use Docker.  With Docker, you have an Airflow environment that works across different operating systems and is started
with a single command.  No Airflow dependencies are needed on your host machine with this approach.  Since Airflow
often has a complex setup with multiple containers, I use Docker Compose to orchestrate them.
</p>
<p>
I’ve created multiple Airflow development environments of varying degrees of complexity.  The major difference between
these environments comes down to the executor, which is the component of Airflow which runs scheduled tasks.  The three
development environments in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/master/Airflow">
data-analytics-prototypes</a> repository utilize <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/
master/Airflow/sequential-executor">sequential</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/
tree/master/Airflow/local-executor">local</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/
tree/master/Airflow/celery-executor">celery</a> executors.
</p>
<p>
The simplest executor is the sequential executor, which is not recommended for production usage.  Even for development
use it can become a bottleneck, because it runs tasks sequentially, one at a time.  However, when you are just getting
started, the sequential executor is likely sufficient.
</p>
<p>
The configuration for the sequential executor local environment consists of a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
data-analytics-prototypes/blob/master/Airflow/sequential-executor/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> and a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/blob/master/Airflow/sequential-executor/
docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file.  The contents of these files are shown below.

<p>
The Docker Compose file runs a container based on the Dockerfile.  With this setup, a simple
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">docker-compose up</code> command from the command line will start the Airflow
server.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go over these files in a bit more detail.  The <strong>Dockerfile</strong> uses an official Airflow image,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">apache/airflow:2.2.0-python3.8</code>, as its base image.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">RUN</code> command initializes the Airflow metastore database
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">airflow db init</code>) and creates a user that can sign into the Airflow
webserver (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">airflow users create</code>).  For the sequential executor, the
Airflow metastore uses SQLite as its database engine.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> file runs a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">airflow</code> service
using the <strong>Dockerfile</strong>, as specified by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">dockerfile: Dockerfile
</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">airflow</code> service starts a container, executing the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">airflow webserver & airflow scheduler</code> command.  This command starts the
Airflow webserver in the background and the Airflow scheduler in the foreground.  The Airflow webserver is exposed on
port <strong>8080</strong>, and accessible when run locally at <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong>.
</p>
<p>
There are two volumes attached to the container.  The first is a location to hold Airflow logs, specified by
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">logs:/opt/airflow/logs</code>.  The second is a location in my local filesystem
holding Airflow DAGs, specified by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">../dags:/opt/airflow/dags</code>.  The
relative path from my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/master/Airflow/
sequential-executor">docker-compose.yml</a> file to my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/
tree/master/Airflow/dags">dags</a> directory is <strong>../dags</strong>.  This <strong>dags</strong> directory is
mounted on the container within <strong>/opt/airflow/dags</strong>.  This directory is where the Airflow scheduler reads
DAGs from.
</p>
<p>
The Docker Compose setup also includes environment variables that configure Airflow.  These environment variables are
defined under <code className="jarombek-inline-code">x-environment: &airflow_environment</code> and are attached to the
container with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">environment: *airflow_environment</code> configuration.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR</code> sets the type of executor that Airflow uses.
Setting <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES=False</code> tells Airflow to exclude
example DAGs from the Airflow environment; Airflow loads example DAGs for reference by default.  Setting
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">AIRFLOW__CORE__STORE_DAG_CODE=True</code> stores DAG files in the Airflow
metastore and setting <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AIRFLOW__CORE__STORE_SERIALIZED_DAGS=True</code> serializes
the DAGs when storing them in the metastore.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=True</code> allows users to view the Airflow configuration from the web server.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS</code> is used to install additional Python
dependencies in the Airflow environment.  In my case, I install a single additional dependency,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">apache-airflow-providers-postgres</code>.  This library supplies Airflow
operators (templates for Airflow tasks) that work with a PostgreSQL database.
</p>
<p>
Development environments using the local executor and the celery executor build upon the Docker configuration for the
sequential executor.  The local executor operates on a single machine, similar to the sequential executor.  However,
unlike the sequential executor, which runs only one task at a time, the local executor runs multiple tasks in
parallel<sup>7</sup>.  The celery executor not only runs tasks in parallel, but can also distribute tasks across
multiple machines. The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/blob/master/Airflow/
local-executor/docker-compose.yml">local executor environment</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
data-analytics-prototypes/blob/master/Airflow/celery-executor/docker-compose.yml">celery executor environment</a> Docker
Compose files are available on GitHub.

<p>
Let’s shift our attention to building pipelines (DAGs) in Airflow.  All the DAGs in my Airflow environment exist in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/master/Airflow/dags">dags</a> directory.  To follow
along, you can run a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">docker-compose up</code> command from the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/tree/master/Airflow/sequential-executor">
Airflow/sequential-executor</a> directory of my repository and navigate to <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong> in a
web browser.

<p>
To get started, here is a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/data-analytics-prototypes/blob/master/Airflow/
dags/hello_world.py">"Hello World" style DAG</a> that contains two simple tasks.

<p>
Airflow contains a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DAG</code> class, which is used to create a DAG.  One way to
initialize a DAG is with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">with DAG(...) as dag:</code> syntax, as shown in
the code above. Inside the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">with</code> statement, Airflow Tasks are defined which
are part of the DAG.  The DAG above has two tasks: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_task</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">python_task</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_task</code> runs
a Bash script, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">python_task</code> runs a Python function.  The order in which
these tasks are run is defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_task >> python_task</code> operator
syntax.  This line says that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_task</code> runs first, followed by
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">python_task</code>.  More details about the order between tasks (task
relationships) can be found in the <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/
tasks.html#relationships">Airflow documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_task</code> is created with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
BashOperator()</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BashOperator()</code> takes a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bash_command</code> argument containing a command to run in a Bash shell.  The
command, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">echo "Hello from Airflow!"'</code> prints "Hello from Airflow!" to the
Airflow logs.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">python_task</code> is created with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PythonOperator()</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PythonOperator()
</code> takes a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">python_callable</code> argument, which is a Python function.  The
Python function, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">task()</code>, prints out the current time to the Airflow logs.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DAG()</code> initializer takes arguments which configure the DAG.  The DAG
is given the name <strong>hello_world</strong> (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dag_id="hello_world"</code>),
provided a description (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">description="..."</code>), and is provided default
arguments (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">default_args=default_args</code>).  Default arguments are arguments
that are passed along to all the tasks within a DAG<sup>8</sup>.  Similar to DAGs, tasks take arguments to alter their
configuration.
</p>
<p>
The DAG is also given a timeout of two hours (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dagrun_timeout=timedelta(hours=2)
</code>).  If two hours are exceeded, the DAG is stopped and marked as a failure.  The DAG is not given a schedule
interval, meaning that it does not get triggered on any specified time (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">
schedule_interval=None</code>).  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">default_view="graph"</code> means that when
clicking on the DAG in the Airflow web server, the graph view is shown by default (as shown in the image above).
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">tags=["sample", "python", "bash"]</code> attaches three tags to the DAG.  Tags
are searchable in the DAG list page of the web server, allowing you to easily find data pipelines as the number of DAGs
grows.  For example, the following screenshot shows the result of me filtering by the "python" tag.

SwiftUI is a new framework that creates user interfaces for iOS and other Apple operating system applications.  SwiftUI
is completely programmatic (user interfaces in SwiftUI are built exclusively by writing Swift code).  This is in stark
contrast to previous frameworks such as UIKit which use a combination of Swift or Objective-C code and storyboards.
Storyboards are graphical interfaces which allow engineers or designers to build user interfaces without writing code.
</p>
<p>
As someone who prefers solutions that involve writing code exclusively, SwiftUI is a welcome addition to the iOS
landscape and a positive change in direction from Apple.  Using GUIs such as storyboard to build interfaces have many
downsides, such as difficulties when working in large groups on a single UI file and confusing merge conflicts when
using version control systems. Since I’m very passionate about programming (as most software engineers are), altering
values in a GUI to change a UI is a lot less exciting than coding!

This article introduces SwiftUI and walks through a page in an existing iOS application that I converted to SwiftUI
from UIKit and Storyboard.  I also describe the steps needed to integrate  SwiftUI components into a UIKit application.
All the code discussed in this article comes from my
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/saintsxctf/id1298285886?platform=iphone">SaintsXCTF</a> iOS application and
lives in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios">saints-xctf-ios</a> repository.

SwiftUI is a new approach for creating user interfaces in Apple operating system applications, such as iPhone and Apple
Watch apps.  Released in September 2019, SwiftUI allows UIs to be built entirely in Swift code.  Apple has
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views">excellent tutorials</a> for getting
started with SwiftUI and learning how to code SwiftUI views in XCode.
</p>

SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework, similar to React.js.  Declarative programming frameworks involve coding the
desired end state instead of coding iterative commands to achieve an end state.  Behind the scenes, SwiftUI is able to
translate the desired end state into iterative commands which build the UI.  Engineers do not need to worry about these
details as SwiftUI abstracts them away.  Declarative frameworks are often easier to work with and faster to code in.  A
comparison in the front-end programming world is how the declarative library React.js is easier to work with then the
iterative library JQuery for building web pages.

In my SaintsXCTF iOS application, the page I converted from UIKit and Storyboard to SwiftUI is the create exercise log
page.  When loaded, this page appears like so:
</p>
<InlineImage filename="2-26-22-exercise-log-view.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
Users enter details about their exercise, such as the time taken and mileage.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="2-26-22-exercise-log-editing.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
After entering information about an exercise, users can create the exercise log, which will display it on the
application home page and on their profile page.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="2-26-22-exercise-log-created.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
User’s can also edit existing exercise logs and resubmit them.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="2-26-22-exercise-logs.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<InlineImage filename="2-26-22-edit-exercise-log.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">

SwiftUI applications are split into many views (components) that make up the user interface.  For my exercise log page,
there are two top level views.  The first, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CreateExerciseLogView</code>, is for
creating a new exercise log.  The second, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">EditExerciseLogView</code>, is for
editing an existing exercise log.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CreateExerciseLogView</code>, which is located in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios/blob/master/SaintsXCTF/CreateExerciseLogView.swift">CreateExerciseLogView.swift</a> file, has
the following content:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
import SwiftUI

struct CreateExerciseLogView: View {
    @StateObject var log = ExerciseLog()
    @StateObject var meta = ExerciseLogMeta(isExisting: false)
    @StateObject var createLog = CreateExerciseLog()
    @StateObject var form = ExerciseLogForm()

    var body: some View {
        ExerciseLogView(log: log, meta: meta, createLog: createLog, form: form)
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CreateExerciseLogView</code>, which is located in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios/blob/master/SaintsXCTF/EditExerciseLogView.swift">EditExerciseLogView.swift</a> file, is coded
very similarly.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
import SwiftUI

struct EditExerciseLogView: View {
    @ObservedObject var log = ExerciseLog()

    @StateObject var meta = ExerciseLogMeta(isExisting: true)
    @StateObject var createLog = CreateExerciseLog()
    @StateObject var form = ExerciseLogForm()

    var body: some View {
        ExerciseLogView(log: log, meta: meta, createLog: createLog, form: form)
            .onAppear(perform: {
                if !meta.existingLogInitialized {
                    form.displayedTime = log.time
                }
            })
    }
}

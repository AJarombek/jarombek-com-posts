In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-28-2022-swiftui-uikit">previous article</a>, I discussed SwiftUI and how to
integrate SwiftUI components into a UIKit application.  SwiftUI is a (relatively) new framework for creating user
interfaces in Apple ecosystem applications.  User interfaces built using SwiftUI are configured completely in code with
Swift.  In this article, I discuss how to UI test SwiftUI views in an iOS application.

UI testing is a form of integration test and end to end test where a user interface is tested in a manner similar to
how a user interacts with it.  For example, a UI test may click a button in a user interface, and assert that something
appears on the screen in response to that button click.  Iâ€™ve discussed UI testing frameworks such as
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-11-2021-cypress-typescript">Cypress</a> and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jul-26-2021-aws-synthetics-canary">AWS Synthetics Canary Functions (which utilize Selenium and Puppeteer)</a> in prior
articles, both of which are designed for testing web applications.

If you are looking for a step by step guide for how to get started with building UI tests in the XCode IDE,
<a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/83/how-to-test-your-user-interface-using-xcode">this article</a> is a
good place to start<sup>1</sup>.  If you want to view the UI test code discussed in this article, it is available in my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios/tree/master/SaintsXCTFUITests">saints-xctf-ios</a> repository on
GitHub.

The application under test is my <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/saintsxctf/id1298285886?platform=iphone">
SaintsXCTF</a> iOS app, which allows users to log their running exercises.  It was built for my college cross country
and track & field teams.  The page under test is a SwiftUI view that allows users to create exercise logs.  This view is
shown below.

In my codebase, there is a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios/blob/master/SaintsXCTFUITests/
ExerciseLogUITests.swift">ExerciseLogUITests.swift</a> file which contains the UI tests for the create exercise log
view.  UI tests are outlined with the following Swift code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
// ExerciseLogUITests.swift
    
import XCTest

class ExerciseLogUITests: XCTestCase {

    lazy var app = XCUIApplication()

    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        app.launchArguments += ["UI_TESTING"]
        continueAfterFailure = false
    }

    override func tearDownWithError() throws {}

    ...
}

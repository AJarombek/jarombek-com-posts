Recently I read <a href="https://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a> in hopes to better understand Go and
discover what makes it unique as a language.  One feature of Go that peaked my interest was goroutines.  Goroutines are a
mechanism for achieving concurrency and parallelism in Go programs.  Many programming languages provide libraries for
using multiple threads to achieve concurrency and sometimes even multiple processes, but Go takes a more distinct
approach with goroutines.

<p>
Goroutines as a means of concurrent programming lead me to ask many questions, all of which Iâ€™ll attempt to answer in
this article.  These questions are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#">What is a goroutine?</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Why does Go use goroutines instead of threads?</a></li>
<li><a href="#">What are channels and how do they relate to goroutines?</a></li>
<li><a href="#">What is the difference between a thread and a goroutine?</a></li>
<li><a href="#">What is the difference between a coroutine and a goroutine?</a></li>
</ul>

<Definition word="Goroutine">
A goroutine is an activity within a Go program<sup>1</sup>.  Using goroutines, engineers can write concurrent and
parallel programs.  When a Go program starts and calls its <code className="jarombek-inline-code">main()</code> method,
it runs in a <strong>main goroutine</strong><sup>2</sup>.  This is similar in concept to a <strong>main thread</strong>
in languages like Java and Python, although goroutines and threads are distinct entities.  A new goroutine is created
in a Go program using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go</code> keyword.  In a program with multiple
goroutines, each goroutine runs concurrently, and if the computer running the program has multiple CPUs or cores,
potentially in parallel.

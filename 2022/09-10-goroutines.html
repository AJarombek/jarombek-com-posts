Recently I read <a href="https://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a> in hopes to better understand Go and
discover what makes it a unique language.  One Go feature that peaked my interest was goroutines.  Goroutines are a
mechanism for achieving concurrency and parallelism in Go programs.  Many programming languages provide libraries that
 use multiple threads or processes to achieve concurrency, but Go takes a more distinct approach.
</p>
<p>
Go's use of Goroutines to achieve concurrent programming lead me to ask many questions, all of which I'll attempt to answer in
this article.  The questions are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-is-a-goroutine">What is a goroutine?</a></li>

<SectionTitle title="What is a goroutine">What is a goroutine?</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Goroutine">
A goroutine is an activity within a Go program<sup>1</sup>.  Using goroutines, engineers can write concurrent and
parallel programs.  When a Go program starts and calls its <code className="jarombek-inline-code">main()</code> function,
it runs in a <strong>main goroutine</strong><sup>2</sup>.  This is similar conceptually to a <strong>main thread</strong>
in languages like Java and Python, although goroutines and threads are distinct entities.  A new goroutine is created
in a Go program using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go</code> keyword.  In a program with multiple
goroutines, each goroutine runs concurrently, and if the computer running the program has multiple CPUs or cores,
potentially in parallel.
</Definition>
<p>
As a basic example, the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/blob/main/goroutines/basic_example/
basic_example.go">following code</a> starts a separate goroutine from the main goroutine of an application.  Both
goroutines simply print text to standard output and exit.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func otherGoroutine() {
	fmt.Println("Other Goroutine")
}

func main() {
	go otherGoroutine()

	// Wait a second in the main goroutine to make it more likely
	// for the other goroutine to run until completion
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	fmt.Println("Main Goroutine")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One thing to note is when the main goroutine exists (the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">main()</code> function
completes), all other goroutines are forced to exit as well<sup>3</sup>.  Therefore, it is possible the child goroutine
is forced to close before it can print "Other Goroutine".  In production code, there are ways to wait for other goroutines
 to run until completion.

What is the difference between a thread and a goroutine?
</SectionTitle>
<p>
A <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-1-2020-python-concurrency#thread">thread</a>, also known as a lightweight
process, is the most basic unit of scheduling on most computers.  I wrote
about threads, the difference between concurrency and parallelism, along with other multithreading concepts in a
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-1-2020-python-concurrency">previous article on Python</a>.
</p>
<p>
Threads come in two different forms: kernel threads and user threads.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Threads">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Kernel Thread
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Kernel threads, also known as OS threads, are threads that are managed by the operating system in kernel mode.
Running in Kernel mode allows OS threads to have unrestricted access to the underlying hardware they run
on<sup>4</sup>.  Kernel threads contain a virtualized processor, stack space, and program state from the process they
run within<sup>5</sup>.  Although kernel threads require operating system support, all modern operating systems support
them<sup>6</sup>.  An example of a kernel thread library is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pthreads">
Pthreads</a>.  You can find examples of pthreads in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
system-programming-prototypes/tree/main/pthreads">system-programming-prototypes</a> repository.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
User Thread
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A user thread is similar to an OS thread, except it exists in user space and isn't managed by the operating system.
Instead, user threads are written and managed in code, such as within the standard libraries for programming languages.
While they require lots of user space code to implement, the benefits of user threads include fewer expenses from
context switches and more application control<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
There are multiple threading models for mapping user threads to kernel threads.  In reality, all threads used in
application code are user threads.  However, depending on the threading model, user threads can utilize kernel threads
for their execution strategy (as is the case with the 1:1 threading model) or be dependent on user space code to
handle threading (as is the case with n:1 and n:m threading models).  Knowing the differences between threading
models along with kernel threads and user threads is critical for understanding goroutines.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Threading Models">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
1:1 (Kernel-Level Threading)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The 1:1 threading model is where every user thread is mapped to a single kernel thread.  Different ways to think of
this threading model are user threads implementing kernel threading functionality, or user threads existing as a wrapper
around kernel threads.  1:1 Threading is also known as kernel-level threading<sup>7</sup>.  Pthreads are an example of
 the 1:1 threading model, which is why I previously described them as an example of a kernel thread.
While their code isn't strictly in kernel space, every user thread created with pthreads maps directly to a single,
unique kernel thread; user threads and kernel threads in pthreads form a one-to-one relationship.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of 1:1 threading is that kernel threads can be scheduled and run on separate CPUs or cores.  This means
that kernel threads can run in parallel on a multicore or multiprocessor machine.  The downside of 1:1 threading is
that context switches between threads are expensive, and operating systems set a (configurable) limit to the number
of kernel threads that can be created.  For example, on Linux, the maximum number of threads is viewable with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</code> command<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
N:1 (User-Level Threading)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The n:1 threading model is where multiple user threads are all mapped to a single kernel thread.  N:1 threading is
also known as user-level threading.  Historically, the Java threading library used n:1 threading (known as green
threads), although this system is no longer used<sup>9,10</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The benefits of n:1 threading are reduced performance costs related to context switching and more control in user space.
However, on modern architectures, it is important for threads to take advantage of multiple cores and processors.
Since the n:1 threading model maps user threads to a single kernel thread, all user-level threads are executed on a
single core and a single processor.  The performance loss of not taking advantage of multiple cores or processors
far outweighs any benefits gained from reducing context switches (on multicore/multiprocessor machines), making N:1
threading a seldomly used approach.  Also, the amount of complex user level code needed to maintain user-level threads
is another detriment to n:1 threading.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
N:M (Hybrid Threading)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The n:m threading model is where <i>m</i> user threads are mapped to <i>n</i> kernel threads.  N:M threading is also
known as hybrid threading.
</p>
<p>
For example, take a program that implements hybrid threading and distributes 20 user threads to four kernel threads.  If
the computer this program runs on has a four core processor, these four kernel threads can be distributed evenly across the
processing cores, allowing kernel threads to run in parallel.  However, from the appearance of the application,
20 threads were created, not four.
</p>
<p>
Hybrid threading attempts to benefit from both kernel-level threading and user-level threading.  By utilizing kernel
threads, hybrid threads are able to achieve parallelism on multicore or multiprocessor machines.  By utilizing user
threads, hybrid threads reduce the cost of context switches and provide more power to user-space code.  The downside of
hybrid threads is they are complex to implement<sup>11</sup>.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
Many programming languages utilize kernel-level threads (the 1:1 threading model).  Modern implementations of
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html">Java threads</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html">Python threads</a> utilize kernel threading under the hood
(In Java, this is referred to as native threading)<sup>12,13</sup>.  One differentiating factor for goroutines compared
to Java or Python threads is that Go maps <i>m</i> goroutines to <i>n</i> kernel threads, thus making it follow the
hybrid threading (n:m) model<sup>14</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Why does Go use goroutines instead of threads">
Why does Go use goroutines instead of threads?
</SectionTitle>
<p>
After learning that Go uses hybrid threading instead of a more common kernel threading approach, the question I began
to wonder was why?  Go is a much newer language than Java and Python, which were first released in 1996 and 1991,
respectively.  Therefore, Go had the benefit of hindsight when it chose its threading model.  By using hybrid
threading, goroutines (which exist in user space) are able to have custom functionality that makes concurrent code
easier to use and write.  Hybrid threading also reduces the cost of context switching in a scenario where the number
of goroutines is greater than the number of cores and processors in a machine.  This results in more efficient
concurrent code while still leveraging a machine's architecture for parallelism.
</p>
<p>
While reading Go documentation and <a href="https://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a>, writers are quick to
point out that goroutines are not threads.  In many ways, I find it easier to think of goroutines as user threads with
some unique attributes.  One of the biggest differences between goroutines and typical
threads is that threads have a fixed-sized stack space while goroutines have a dynamically-sized stack
space<sup>15</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I believe dynamically-sized stack space is the best feature of goroutines.  Kernel threads have a fixed-size stack
space where the size is architecture dependent, but is often large enough to prevent a stack overflow.  There is also a
configurable limit to the number of kernel threads on a machine.  This leads to scalability
issues when a program attempts to execute many operations concurrently.
</p>
<p>
When goroutines are initialized, their stack space is small, often around 2KB according to the
documentation<sup>15</sup>.  The stack space of a thread is often 100 times as big, 2MB in the case of pthreads on a 64
bit x86 architecture<sup>16</sup>.  In some cases, the stack size for a thread is even larger than 2MB.  The small
(and scalable) stack space of goroutines allows magnitudes more of them to be created compared to threads<sup>17</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The scalable nature of goroutines has the same impact on concurrent code as scalable cloud resources has on
infrastructure; goroutines make concurrent code easier to write and manage and allows for architectural designs
impossible in more rigid systems.  As cloud platforms like AWS allow infrastructure to scale with consumer demand,
goroutines are able to scale with growing concurrent workloads.  Concurrent processes that are difficult to create
with threads in libraries like pthreads or languages like Java and Python may be easier in Go with goroutines.
</p>
<p>
Goroutines also abstract away much of the complexity around concurrent code.  In my
opinion, prefixing any Go function with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">go</code> keyword is an elegant way
to implement a concurrency library; in my experience, goroutines are easier to use and learn compared to other
threading libraries.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What are channels and how do they relate to goroutines">
What are channels and how do they relate to goroutines?
</SectionTitle>
<p>
In Go, channels are a way to communicate between goroutines.  Let's take a basic example where integer values are
passed to a goroutine via a channel and returned from the same goroutine via another channel.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func double(out chan int, in chan int) {
	for {
		value := <-in
		result := value * 2
		out <- result
	}
}

func main() {
	out := make(chan int)
	in := make(chan int)

	go double(out, in)

	in <- 2
	result := <-out
	fmt.Printf("Double 2 = %d\n", result) // Double 2 = 4

	in <- 5
	result = <-out
	fmt.Printf("Double 5 = %d\n", result) // Double 5 = 10

	close(out)
	close(in)
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">make(chan int)</code> syntax creates a new integer channel.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">double()</code> function, which is run as a goroutine with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">go double(out, in)</code> statement, takes two channels as arguments.  Within
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">double()</code>, the statement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
value := <-in</code> reads a value from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">in</code> channel.  After doubling
the value, the statement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">out <- result</code> writes the doubled value to the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">out</code> channel.
</p>
<p>
In the main goroutine, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">in <- 2</code> statement sends a value to the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">in</code> channel and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
result := <-out</code> statement reads a value from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">out</code> channel and
assigns it to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">result</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">double()</code> function can be refactored to use unidirectional channels,
 which specify the directional flow of data through channels in their type definitions<sup>18</sup>.  The directional
 flow of data in a unidirectional channel must be obeyed.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
func double(out chan<- int, in <-chan int) {
	for {
		value := <-in
		result := value * 2
		out <- result
	}
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">chan<- int</code> is a send-only integer channel and
 type <code className="jarombek-inline-code"><-chan int</code> is a receive only integer channel<sup>18</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Another way to refactor this example is to use buffered channels.  Buffered channels represent queues with a
specified size, compared to a standard channel which holds a single element.  Here is a final version of the code
 using buffered channels and unidirectional channels.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func double(out chan<- int, in <-chan int) {
	for {
		value := <-in
		result := value * 2
		out <- result
	}
}

func main() {
	out := make(chan int, 2)
	in := make(chan int, 2)

	go double(out, in)

	in <- 2
	in <- 5

	result := <-out
	fmt.Printf("Double 2 = %d\n", result) // Double 2 = 4

	result = <-out
	fmt.Printf("Double 5 = %d\n", result) // Double 5 = 10

	close(out)
	close(in)
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Channels in Go remind me of multiple different technologies, ranging from message brokers like RabbitMQ to generators
and coroutines in Python.  In Go, the syntax for channels is simple, making them easy to work with.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is the difference between a coroutine and a goroutine">
What is the difference between a coroutine and a goroutine?
</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Coroutine">
A coroutine is a function or subroutine that allows its execution to be suspended and resumed
cooperatively<sup>19</sup>.  In Python, coroutines are functions that yield their control flow; they are functions
containing a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword in their bodies<sup>20</sup>.  Coroutines are
similar to kernel threads because they enable concurrent execution, but unlike threads do not enable
parallelism<sup>21</sup>.  Coroutines also follow cooperative multitasking, unlike kernel threads which follow
preemptive multitasking<sup>22</sup>.  In other words, coroutines yield control of a program on their own terms
whenever they wish, while kernel threads are forced to yield control by the operating system.
</Definition>
<p>
Coroutines are a programming concept I first encountered while learning Python.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">double()</code> goroutine used in the previous section is easily rewritten as a
Python coroutine.  This code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/python-programming/blob/
v1.0.0/coroutines/coroutines.py">coroutines.py</a> file on GitHub.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def double():
    """
    A coroutine that takes a number and multiples it by two.
    The result is yielded back to the caller.
    """
    while True:
        value = yield
        result = value * 2
        yield result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    double_coroutine = double()

    next(double_coroutine)
    result = double_coroutine.send(2)
    assert result == 4

    next(double_coroutine)
    result = double_coroutine.send(5)
    assert result == 10
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In many ways, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">double()</code> implemented as a goroutine in Go and a coroutine
in Python are functionally the same.  Both are unblocking calls that yield execution, waiting for a value.  In the
Python coroutine, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword is used to wait for a value to be
passed by its caller.  In the goroutine, a channel is used to wait for a value to be passed by another goroutine.  Both
the coroutine and the goroutine emit values as well.  The coroutine passes values back to its caller using the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">yield</code> keyword, while the goroutine passes values to other goroutines
through a channel.
</p>
<p>
While it's reasonable to guess that goroutines are simply coroutines, there are crucial differences.  Coroutines do not
enable concurrency or parallelism on their own<sup>23</sup>.  Meanwhile, goroutines implement hybrid threading and
preemptive multitasking.  A library such as <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-1-2020-python-concurrency
#concurrent-programming-with-asyncio">asyncio</a>, which is built on top of coroutines in Python, has more in common
with goroutines than coroutines.  I wrote about <strong>asyncio</strong> along with other
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-1-2020-python-concurrency">Python concurrent programming concepts</a> in a
prior article.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Goroutines are a very interesting part of the Go programming language, and I'll likely leverage them next time I have
a codebase with large amounts of concurrency and parallelism. Goroutines make concurrent programming easy, hiding a
complex hybrid threading model behind simplistic language syntax and semantics.  Go code shown in this article along
with other goroutine and channel examples are available in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/go-programming/
tree/main/goroutines">go-programming repository on GitHub</a>.

SwiftUI is a new framework that creates user interfaces for iOS and other Apple operating system applications.  SwiftUI
is completely programmatic (user interfaces in SwiftUI are built exclusively by writing Swift code).  This is in stark
contrast to previous frameworks such as UIKit which use a combination of Swift or Objective-C code and storyboards.
Storyboards are graphical interfaces which allow engineers or designers to build user interfaces without writing code.

As someone who prefers solutions that involve writing code exclusively, SwiftUI is a welcome addition to the iOS
landscape and a positive change in direction from Apple.  Using GUIs such as storyboard to build interfaces have many
downsides, such as difficulties when working in large groups on a single UI file and confusing merge conflicts when
using version control systems. Since Iâ€™m very passionate about programming (as most software engineers are), altering
values in a GUI to change a UI is a lot less exciting than coding!

This article introduces SwiftUI and walks through a page in an existing iOS application that I converted to SwiftUI
from UIKit and Storyboard.  I also describe the steps needed to integrate  SwiftUI components into a UIKit application.
All the code discussed in this article comes from my
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/saintsxctf/id1298285886?platform=iphone">SaintsXCTF</a> iOS application and
lives in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios">saints-xctf-ios</a> repository.

At the beginning of my undergraduate journey, I entered the realm of engineering and code without any ambition or
tangible goals.  All I knew was, at the time, I despised the academic cycle of reading a book, interpreting it in
class, writing an essay, and presenting findings in front of schoolmates.  Instead, I wanted to be outside, running with
my cross country team; or inside, playing on my computer and spending time with friends.  Knowing that I had no choice
but to go to class, taking <a href="">Computer Science 101</a> my Freshman year seemed like a decent compromise.

I discovered on the first day, when I loaded up a PyCharm IDE on a university iMac and typed in
<code>1 + 1</code> into an empty <a href="">Python</a> file, was a world of more
questions than answers.  Why do we need an <a href="">IDE</a> to run Python code?  What <i>is</i> an IDE?  Do
professionals use the Python programming language?  Are any of the <a href="">applications</a> on my
<a href="">computer</a> written in Python?  Why do we need <a href="">programming languages</a> to begin with?  How
does Python <i>know</i> that 1 + 1 = 2?

More than ten years after I first started writing code, my list of questions and unsolved mysteries only grows.  The
unknown is what keeps me coming back for more.  In this series of articles, I discuss technological discoveries I have
made during my 11 years engineering software.  Clicking links in each article takes you further into the programming
labyrinth that has been constructed in my mind.

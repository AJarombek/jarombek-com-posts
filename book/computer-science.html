Computer Science is the study of developing <a href="">software</a> on <a href="">computers</a> to solve problems.  I
studied Computer Science at St. Lawrence University from 2013 to 2017, and fell in love with it.  In Computer Science,
understanding technologies and how to leverage them to create applications and solve problems is equally important as
the ability to collaborate with other engineers.  The first thing a computer scientist learns is how to code in a
<a href="">programming language</a>.

Programming languages come in many forms, with different strengths and, far too often, painful weaknesses.  Many
seasoned engineers are overly opinionated about which language they prefer, although in most cases, the language that
is easiest for an engineering team to use is often the best.  Ease of use is one of the main contributing factors for
the rise of Python.  The <a href="">Python programming language</a> is one of, if not the most popular programming
languages today<sup>1,2</sup>.  On the other hand, according to recent stackoverflow surveys, the programming
language engineers admire the most is <a href="">Rust</a><sup>3</sup>.

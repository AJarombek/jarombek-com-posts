I've learned a lot about Java over the past few months.  I've read books on it, built projects
with it at work, and even posting on this website about it!  Its obvious when looking at some of my old Java
code how far I've progressed (especially since my SaintsXCTF Android app).  I decided to pull a bunch of
concepts I've learned together and build an API in Java.  This discovery goes through the API and my
design decisions throughout.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The API">The API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The API I built for this discovery post has two major pieces.  The first is a workout API.  It has an
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface along with two concrete classes that implement
it - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code>.  I am
an avid runner and have been experimenting with nordic skiing so I thought they would be appropriate.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The second piece of the API holds a blockchain data structure.  I've started to read about blockchain in my
free time so I thought it would be cool to implement a similar data structure in Java.  An important
note - the blockchain data structure I built is extremely primitive.  In fact it is almost unrecognizable
next to the structure used in modern day blockchain technologies.  All my Java code does is implement a chain
of blocks that contain a list of transactions.  That is it.
</p>
<p>
Here is the dependency graph for my blockchain API:
</p>

</figure>
<SectionTitle title="The Workout API">The Workout API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The workout API is much simpler so lets start there.  At the top of the API is the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface, which both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Run</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> implement.  This interface defines the methods
that all exercises must have.  For three of these methods the implementing class must supply the method body.
However one of the methods has a default implementation, which is used when the implementing class
doesn't override it.  I made a whole discovery post on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-16-2018-java-default-method">default methods in Java</a> if you want
to learn more.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface Exercise {

    double getMiles();

    Duration getTime();

    LocalDate getDate();

    default Duration pace() {
        long secondsPerMile = getTime().toSeconds() / 60;
        return Duration.ofSeconds(secondsPerMile);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now let's look at the first implementing class - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code>.  This class
represents a running exercise.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class implements one other
interface besides for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> called
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code>
interface has one method called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">compareTo()</code> which is used to compare
two objects of the same type.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code> interface gives
objects a natural ordering, which allows them to be sorted in a logical way<sup>1</sup>.  It
also allows them to work properly with sorted collections such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
TreeMap</code> and static methods such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Arrays.sort()</code><sup>2</sup>.
If you ever have a class with a logical ordering, definitely implement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Comparable</code>!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
import static java.util.Comparator.comparing;

public class Run implements Exercise, Comparable&lt;Run&gt; {

    private static final Comparator&lt;Run&gt; COMPARATOR =
        comparing(Run::getDate)
        .thenComparingDouble(Run::getMiles)
        .thenComparing(Run::getTime)
        .thenComparing(run -> run.surface);

    ...

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Run run) {
        return COMPARATOR.compare(this, run);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With Java 8's introduction of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Comparator</code> construction methods,
overriding the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">compareTo()</code> method is extremely easy<sup>3</sup>.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">comparing()</code> static method above takes in a lambda function, specifying
a sorting key.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">comparing()</code> can be chained
with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">thenComparing()</code>, which is used in case of a tie.  In my
code, the first item compared is the date of the run, followed by the miles run, etc.  Note that I use
a method reference instead of a lambda function.
</p>
<Definition word="Method Reference">
A method reference is a shorthand notation for a lambda function (also known as an arrow function).  A common
use case of a lambda is to simply call a method on the input parameter.  Example:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">(Car car) -> car.getModelYear()</code>.  In Java, simple lambdas that
call an existing method can use a method reference<sup>4</sup>.  The example above can be rewritten with a method
reference as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Car::getModelYear()</code>.  Note that we use the class and not the
instance itself in the method reference (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Car</code> not
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">car</code>).  This is because
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">car</code> isn't explicitly defined anywhere for use in the method
reference.  The only case where you would use an instance in a method reference is when calling a method on an
existing variable outside the lambdas scope<sup>5</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
Another interesting aspect of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class is it doesn't have
a public constructor method.  In order to create a new <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> instance
you have to call one of its many static factory methods, which internally make calls to a private constructor.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// enum representing the surface that the run was on.
public enum Surface {
    GRASS, SAND, ROAD, TRACK, TRAIL, UNKNOWN
}

/* Instance Variables */

private final double miles;
private final Duration time;
private final LocalDate date;
private final Surface surface;

/* Private Constructor */

private Run(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date, Surface surface) {
    this.miles = Objects.requireNonNullElse(miles, 0.0);
    this.time = Objects.requireNonNullElse(time, Duration.ZERO);
    this.date = Objects.requireNonNullElse(date, LocalDate.now());
    this.surface = surface;
}

/* Static Factory Methods */

public static Run create(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date, Surface surface) {
    return new Run(miles, time, date, surface);
}

public static Run create(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date) {
    return new Run(miles, time, date, Surface.UNKNOWN);
}

public static Run createNow(double miles, Duration time, Surface surface) {
    return new Run(miles, time, LocalDate.now(), surface);
}

public static Run createNow(double miles, Duration time) {
    return new Run(miles, time, LocalDate.now(), Surface.UNKNOWN);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Static factory methods have some benefits and some drawbacks.  You can use them to be more explicit about what type
of object you are creating or even limit the ways in which constructors are called.  When I say you can
be more explicit I mean you can uniquely name a static factory method.  Constructors on the other hand are
always the name of the class.  A common problem with static factory methods is programmers often don't
know they exist!  To find them they have to search through the JavaDocs, which for large objects can be a hassle.
</p>
<p>
The reason I used static factory methods in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> (and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code>) classes actually has no relation to the reasons I just stated.
When you don't have a public constructor in a class, it is impossible for other classes to extend it
<sup>6</sup>.  Therefore using static factory methods instead of a public constructor stops inheritance!
</p>
<p>
Classes in Java such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> stop inheritance in another way
(by declaring the class as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">final</code>).  But why stop inheritance? What is the benefit?
</p>
<p>
One of the requirements for building immutable objects is prohibiting their class from being subclassed.  You may
have created a perfect immutable class with no side effects, but that doesn't mean a subclass is required
to stay immutable<sup>7</sup>.  This can cause code to behave unexpectedly, since Java variables are
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-13-2018-generics-arrays-complexities-java">covariant</a>.  Removing
inheritance keeps my <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Ski</code> classes immutable!
</p>
<p>
The rest of the code in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class implements the methods defined in
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface along with overriding
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">toString()</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">equals()</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">hashCode()</code> from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> is written similarly to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code>.
You can check out the code in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/
2018/05-May/5-20-Java-Generics-API/exercise/Run.java">Run</a> and

<SectionTitle title="The Blockchain API">The Blockchain API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The blockchain API is a bit more complex.  At the top we have the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BlockChain
</code> interface, which is defined as follows:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface BlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    /**
    * Add an element to the blockchain and return its transaction
    * @param el - the element to be added
    * @return an {@code Optional} value of the transaction added to the blockchain
    */
    Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el);

    /**
    * Find a transaction on the blockchain given its {@code id}
    * @param id - the identifier of a transaction
    * @return an {@code Optional} value of the transaction found on the blockchain
    */
    Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id);

    /**
    * Add a bunch of elements to the blockchain
    * @param elements - a collection of elements to be added to the blockchain.  The parameter
    *                 type is {@code Iterable}, so any class that implements the {@code Iterable}
    *                 interface can be used as an argument.  This includes any class that extends
    *                 {@code Collection}.  The generic type of the {@code Iterable} can be the
    *                 generic type of the blockchain or any subclass.
    */
    void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These are the three key methods used in all blockchain implementations.  One design decision for the
blockchain API was to not have concrete child classes directly implement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
BlockChain</code>.  Instead I created a skeletal implementation of the interface, and had my concrete
classes extend the skeletal implementation.
</p>
<Definition word="Skeletal Implementation">
In Java a Skeletal Implementation is when interfaces and abstract classes are combined to create an enhanced
blueprint for subclasses.  Interfaces are powerful in that they do not break encapsulation (unless you use Java 8's
default methods) while defining the rules for a type.  Abstract classes are powerful because they make
development quicker and are DRY by defining shared code for subclasses.  A problem with abstract classes is that
    they break encapsulation, making subclasses dependent on the abstract class for implementation details<sup>8</sup>.
Interfaces, even with default methods, cant implement details such as instance variables and overridden methods
from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.  Skeletal implementations are abstract classes that also
implement an interface.  The user has two options - either implement the interface or extend the skeletal
implementation - the second of which could save them time since they would write less code.
</Definition>
<p>
In my case the reason for the skeletal implementation is to reuse the overridden methods from
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.  This pattern works well for the blockchain API because in
many cases checking whether two blockchains are equal does not depend on how the blockchain is implemented
under the hood, just if it holds the same data.  The same can't be said for the exercise API.  While
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Bike</code> did share
some fields, they also had unique ones for each implementation.  In that case a skeletal implementation would
not have made sense to implement.
</p>
<p>
As a side note, if a blockchain implementation didn't want to follow the rules enforced in the skeletal
implementation, it could simply implement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BlockChain</code>!
</p>
<p>
Here is my skeletal implementation:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public abstract class AbstractBlockChain&lt;E&gt; implements BlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    // Cache the result of the hashCode() method
    private int hashCode;

    /* Pass along to the child classes */

    @Override
    public abstract Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el);

    @Override
    public abstract Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id);

    @Override
    public abstract void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements);

    abstract List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; getBlockList();

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        var result = hashCode;

        if (result == 0) {
            result = getBlockList().hashCode();
            hashCode = result;
        }

        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == this)
            return true;
        if (!(obj instanceof AbstractBlockChain))
            return false;
        var blockChain = (AbstractBlockChain) obj;
        return Objects.equals(blockChain.getBlockList(), getBlockList());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return getBlockList().toString();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now it is time to look at the meat of the blockchain API - the concrete class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
SimpleBlockChain</code> and the class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code>.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> class extends the skeletal implementation, exposing
three methods to interact with the blockchain.  It also holds a list of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Block</code> instances.  This list is a primitive "block chain."  Each block holds a list of transactions which
occurred as well as a reference to the previous block.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Block</code> is immutable - to add a new transaction to a block a whole
new block instance must be created.  The reason <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Block</code> is immutable is to make it reliable and easy to test!
</p>
<p>
Here is a diagram of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> classes:
</p>
<figure>
    <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/5-20-18-simpleblock.png">
</figure>
<p>
Let's start with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> class:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public final class SimpleBlockChain&lt;E&gt; extends AbstractBlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    // A list of the blocks in the blockchain.
    private List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; blockList;

    // Set the max block size for the blockchain.  Once this limit is exceeded a
    // new block will be initialized.
    private int maxBlockSize = 5;

    public SimpleBlockChain() {
        blockList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(new Block&lt;&gt;(null)));
    }

    @Override
    List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; getBlockList() {
        return blockList;
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the number of transactions per block is five and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getBlockList()</code> method is package private, meaning that implementing code can't access it.
</p>
<p>
Now let's look at the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">add()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
find()</code> methods.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el) {

    // Get the latest block in the blockList.  This is the block we will add to if it isn't full
    var latestBlock = blockList.get(blockList.size() - 1);

    // Reference to the previous block in the blockchain
    var prevBlock = latestBlock.getPrevBlock();

    // If the block isn't full, create a new block that replicates the old one except with
    // the new transaction.  Replace the existing block with this new one.  Otherwise, create a
    // brand new block and add it to the list.
    if (latestBlock.length() &lt; maxBlockSize) {
        System.out.println("Concat with Existing Block");
        latestBlock = latestBlock.concatTransaction(el, prevBlock);

        blockList.remove(blockList.size() - 1);
        blockList.add(latestBlock);

        return latestBlock.lastTransaction();
    } else {
        System.out.println("Creating a New Block");
        Block&lt;E&gt; block = Block.create(latestBlock);
        block = block.concatTransaction(el, prevBlock);

        blockList.add(block);

        return block.lastTransaction();
    }
}

@Override
public Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id) {

    // First filter down the blockList to the block that contains the transaction
    Optional&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; containingBlock = blockList.stream()
        .filter(block -&gt; block.containsTransaction(id)).findFirst();

    // If a block containing the transaction is found, return the transaction.
    // Otherwise return an empty optional.
    if (containingBlock.isPresent()) {
        return containingBlock.get().findTransaction(id);
    } else {
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Both of these methods return an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Optional</code> instance.
I decided to go with this approach so I wouldn't have to throw a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
NullPointerException</code> or return <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code> if the insert or search
failed.  With optionals its explicitly clear to API users that inserting can fail or
a transaction may not exist when searching.  I dedicated an entire discovery post to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-30-2018-java8-optionals">Optionals in Java 8</a> in case you want to learn
more.
</p>
<p>
The last method that needs to be implemented is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code>.  The parameter
type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt;</code> may look a bit unfamiliar.  Let's break
it down.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
public void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements) {
    elements.forEach(this::add);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code> method takes in type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Iterable</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> is an interface for an object that can be
looped through.  For example, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Collection</code> interface extends the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> interface.  That means that all classes in the Java collections
framework implement <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code>, such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ArrayList</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">HashSet</code>.  Since the method parameter of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code> is so generic, a lot of flexibility is given to the API user in
regards to argument passing!
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> parameter also has a generic type of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;? extends E&gt;</code>.  This gives the API user even more flexibility,
since they can pass an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> class with the generic type matching
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> generic type or subtyping the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> generic type.
</p>
<p>
An example would be a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> instance of generic type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.  When passing an argument to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
addAll()</code> all four of the following are valid:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// Create a new blockchain
BlockChain&lt;Exercise&gt; blockChain = new SimpleBlockChain&lt;&gt;();

/* The following four method calls are all valid */
HashSet&lt;Ski&gt; skis = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(skis);

HashSet&lt;Exercise&gt; exercisesSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(exercisesSet);

List&lt;Run&gt; runs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(runs);

List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercisesList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(exercisesList);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Making the API as flexible as possible is very important and can make end users lives much easier!  Imagine the
hassle of having all your data stored in a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LinkedList</code> and then finding
out the API only accepts <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> instances!
</p>
<p>
Time to go over the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> class.  This class doesn't implement an
interface, but adding one would be a good exercise!  The class has one package-private constructor and
one private constructor.  You may initially think its possible to extend this class if you are in
its package.  Although it does have a package-private constructor, the class is declared
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">final</code>, so subclassing is disallowed.  This is good since
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> is immutable.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to show the code for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> class in this post but you
can look at it on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/05-May/
5-20-Java-Generics-API/bchain/Block.java">GitHub</a>.  It even has a nice static member class for
transactions!
</p>
<Definition word="Static Member Class">
In Java a static member class is a static class defined inside a class.  Another option in Java is to have a
non-static member class inside a class.  The big difference is non-static member classes are part
of the outer classes instance - therefore they hold a reference to the contents of the outer class.  Unless
the member class needs access to items in its outer class, it should be defined as static.  This saves both
the time and space required to keep a reference of the outer class instance<sup>9</sup>.

I've been working in Java four years now.  While the first two years were just for simple school assignments,
the past two years I've made production level code in the language.  I am still looking to sharpen my
knowledge on the language all the time.  This API pulled together a lot of concepts I've been working
on lately, and I hope reading about my journey with the language has been helpful!  As always the

Recently I've spent a lot of time working with React.js for my upcoming website (which by the time
you are reading this is completed!).  One of the challenges I faced was dynamically deciding at
runtime which JSX element to render.  It turns out there is a pretty nice solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
This is the first time I've posted about React.js.  Therefore lets quickly review or initiate ourselves with the React library.
</p>
<p>
React.js is a frontend JavaScript library for creating and maintaining views.  Unlike the
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions">Angular framework</a> which I've using before, React does not control any aspect of a project besides
for the views.  This makes it lightweight and gives developers a lot of flexibility and freedom.
</p>
<p>
React creates a virtual layer on top
of the DOM called the Virtual DOM.  React uses the virtual DOM to interact with the real DOM API, allowing
developers to avoid interacting with the DOM itself<sup>1</sup>.  React also has an extremely
effective diffing algorithm which makes updates to the DOM quick by only changing necessary
pieces of the DOM on state changes<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
React is also isomorphic (can be run on multiple platforms), meaning that it does not
have to render its views on the DOM<sup>3</sup>.  It can also render HTML on the server (server-side
rendering) or on mobile apps!  I haven't explored React Native for mobile apps yet but it sounds extremely
cool!  My website takes advantage of server-side rendering, which I will cover in detail in a future discovery.
</p>
<p>
React tries to take advantage of JavaScripts functional aspects.  Much of my React code is
functional, and working with React helps me think functionally - making my code more testable and
maintainable.  I wrote about <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-8-2018-java8-functional">
functional programming in Java</a> and all
the benefits that come with it in a previous discovery.  These benefits carry over to JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
With all these benefits in mind, how do developers work with the virtual DOM React offers?  They do so with React elements, which correspond
to HTML elements.  Each React element is a JavaScript object.  React elements can be grouped together into
modularized components, which can be passed to the virtual DOM.  When a component is passed to the virtual
DOM, the elements inside it are rendered.  This practice allows for easily reusable groups of HTML.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a React component:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";

const Link = ({ name, link }) =>
    React.createElement("a", {href: link}, name);

export default Link;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This React component is very simple, creating a new React element corresponding to the HTML
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element.  This element has a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">href</code> attribute, linking it to a URL.  The URL is passed to the component via the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">link</code> property.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element
also displays text passed to the component by the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> property.
</p>
<p>
The function <code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> creates the React element
corresponding to an HTML element.  You can image how tiresome and verbose it would be to type out this
function for every single HTML element in a webpage.  Luckily there is an
alternative called JSX.  JSX creates React elements in a syntax that looks like HTML.  Here is an
example of the previous component using JSX:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";

const Link = ({ name, link }) => (
    &lt;a href={link}&gt;
        {name}
    &lt;/a&gt;
);

export default Link;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
JSX is easy to read and easier to write (although yes, it is a bit of an eyesore mixing HTML syntax with JavaScript).

</UpdateInfo>
<p>
Now lets get to the issue I faced when building my website.  I wanted to dynamically choose the JSX element type
at runtime based on some JSON I received from a server.  For example, if the JSON had a property
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">tag</code> with the value <code className="jarombek-inline-code">div</code>,
I wanted the JSX element to represent an HTML <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>.  With this
implemented, I could store a JSON representation of HTML and have my React code render it on the fly.
</p>
<p>
The code used by my website is quite involved but the following is the basic process.  First I import
React and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Link</code> component I created prior.
I also create a JavaScript object representing some HTML I want to display:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import Link from "./Link";

const elements = [
    {
        tag: "h1",
        attributes: null,
        value: "Webpage Title"
    },
    {
        tag: "p",
        attributes: null,
        value: "Hey"
    },
    {
        tag: "Link",
        attributes: {
            name: "Check out my GitHub!",
            link: "https://github.com/AJarombek"
        },
        value: "Ok"
    }
];
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The object representation of HTML has three properties.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">tag</code>
defines the HTML element type, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">attributes</code> lists the HTML
attributes, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> contains the content shown inside the HTML tag.
</p>
<p>
Next I loop through the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">elements</code> array and generate some
JSX for each object.  This JSX is rendered in the websites HTML.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const App = () =>
    elements.map(e => {
        let Tag = e.tag;

        // If we are using a custom react component, we must
        // assign it directly.
        if (Tag === "Link") {
            Tag = Link;
        }

        return (
        &lt;Tag key={e.toString()} {...e.attributes}&gt;
            {e.value}
        &lt;/Tag&gt;
        );
    });

render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I created a variable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tag</code> on the
third line representing the JSX element.  Remember that a JSX element is simply syntactic sugar for a
React element, and a React element is a JavaScript object sent to the virtual DOM.
</p>
<p>
Native HTML elements are passed to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> as a
string.  This is why the code above works for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">h1</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">p</code> elements.  If you tried assigning the string <code className="jarombek-inline-code">"Link"</code> to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tag</code> it would not render.  The reason is because
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;Link&gt;</code> is not a valid HTML element!  It is a React component
that I created!  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> takes React
components as arguments also, which is perfect for custom components.  This is the reason for the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">if</code> clause in the code above.
</p>

Here is the end result:

I still have a lot of learning and work to do with React.  So far I am really enjoying it despite a few
things I miss from frameworks like Angular.  But that is for another post!

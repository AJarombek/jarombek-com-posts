A common problem when programming is performing a deep copy of an object or data structure.  In many
languages this is a complex problem, especially when the object gets large.  In Java there are many
different ways to perform a deep copy on an object.  The original language implementation for copying
was the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface.  Since <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> was the first method of copying an object in Java, it is important to understand how it works
along with all its shortcomings.  This is my journey to understand Java’s <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> interface in all its complexity.
</p>
<p>
If you have ever heard or read about Java’s <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface
you likely were told the following three words: <strong>Don’t Use It</strong>.  This is good advice, as there
are many simpler ways to implement deep copying.  Unfortunately there is a lot of code in existence that
already uses <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>.  To understand how it works, first let’s
look at the source code for the interface:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface Cloneable { }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Yes that is it.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is an empty interface that defines no
methods.  While it may seem based off the interface definition that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> does nothing, it actually does quite a lot.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>
determines the implementation details of one of the methods on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>
class.  This method in question is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>, a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">protected</code> method as shown below<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate
protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are a couple of interesting things to note about <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>.
First off it has no method body and is defined with the keyword <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
native</code>.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">native</code> keyword means that the method is
implemented using the Java Native Interface (JNI).  This means that the code is actually not written in
Java, instead it is implemented in another language such as C, C++, or Assembly<sup>2</sup>.  The
basic idea here is that writing the code in a low level machine specific language will increase performance.
</p>
<p>
Another important piece is the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate</code> annotation.
This annotation allows the HotSpot VM (an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine) know that the
implementation of this method may be an intrinsic function<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="Intrinsic Function">
A function that a programming language uses which is handled by the compiler instead of the programming languages
runtime environment<sup>4</sup>.  In other words - an optimized method definition by the compiler is used, replacing
the one in the programming languages library<sup>5</sup>.  Intrinsic functions are used as an optimization technique.
</Definition>
<p>
If there is one thing to take away from the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">native</code> keyword and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate</code> annotation it's that
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> is not handled by the Java language itself.  As Joshua Bloch,
creator of the Java Collections framework says, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is
extralinguistic.  It does not follow Java’s rules.
</p>
<Definition word="Extralinguistic">
Outside the bounds of a language.  In Java something that is extralinguistic is outside the rules enforced
by the language.
</Definition>
<p>
An interface with no defined methods should not be able to change a method implementation in another class.
However <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> does just that.  If a class implements
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>
method performs a deep copy on the object.  If a class does not implement
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> throws
a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">CloneNotSupportedException</code>.  This should not be a legal Java
implementation and it is very confusing.
</p>
<h5>Implementing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code></h5>
<p>
Here is a simple class I made in Java which represents a programming language.  It contains three fields -
name, creation date, and all the paradigms the language follows.  It also has getters and setters
along with a method <code class="jarombek-inline-code">addParadigm()</code> which will mutate the list of
paradigms by adding a new paradigm.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public class Language implements Cloneable {

    private String name;
    private LocalDate inception;
    private List&lt;Paradigm&gt; paradigms;

    enum Paradigm {
        Object_Oriented, Imperative, Functional, Declarative
    }

    public Language(String name, LocalDate inception, List&lt;Paradigm&gt; paradigms) {
        this.name = name;
        this.inception = inception;
        this.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(paradigms);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[" + name + ", " + inception.toString() + ", " + paradigms.toString() + "]";
    }

    /* Getters and Setters */

    // Add a paradigm to the list if a non null value is passed in
    public void addParadigm(Paradigm paradigm) {
        Optional.ofNullable(paradigm).ifPresent(p -> this.paradigms.add(p));
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now here is my first attempt at overriding the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> method:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
protected Language clone() {
    try {
        return (Language) super.clone();
    } catch(CloneNotSupportedException ex) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Interestingly, the cast to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">(Language)</code> here will always succeed.
The catch clause will also never be reached since we implemented <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code>, however we need to include it since <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>
throws a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">CloneNotSupportedException</code>.  If you are thinking to
yourself this doesn’t make much sense I agree wholeheartedly.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> interface does not follow the rules that the rest of Java enforces.
</p>
<p>
Now I will create a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> instance and test out cloning it.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
Language language = new Language("Java", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.MAY, 23),
                            List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                                    Language.Paradigm.Imperative));

Language language2 = language.clone();

System.out.println(language);
System.out.println(language2);

// Name is immutable and Inception is a final singleton, so changing them
// has no impact on the copied language
language.setName("Prolog");
language.setInception(LocalDate.EPOCH);

// This mutation will effect the copy
language.addParadigm(Language.Paradigm.Declarative);

System.out.println(language);
System.out.println(language2);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Before Mutation
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]

# After Mutation
[Prolog, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative, Declarative]]
[Prolog, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative, Declarative]]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Upon studying the output you will see that adding an item to the paradigm list in the first
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> instance actually impacts the cloned instance.  This is
because <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> does not make a deep copy of each field in
an object.  It simply copies the value assigned to the field to the new clone.  In the case of an object, the
copied value is a reference to the object.  Altering the object the reference points to will change the value
in both the original and cloned instances.  Of course this would never be an issue if the type of your fields
were immutable objects (which both <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">LocalDate</code> are).
</p>
<p>
To fix this we need to add another line to the clone method.  This time we will make a new instance of the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> in the clone.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
protected Language clone() {
    try {
        Language language = (Language) super.clone();
        language.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(paradigms);
        return language;
    } catch(CloneNotSupportedException ex) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now the clone is not modified:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Before Mutation
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]

# After Mutation
[Prolog, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative, Declarative]]
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface is very confusing and does not follow the
rules of Java.  Therefore it is encouraged to avoid implementing it in your classes.  To make matters worse,
if an extendable class implements <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> all its subclasses have
to as well<sup>6</sup>.  If the extendable class is client facing, other developers may have to endure
implementing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> too.
</p>
<h5>Alternatives to <code class="jarombek-header-code">Cloneable</code></h5>
<p>
Since we know that implementing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is a bad idea, what
are the alternatives?  The two best choices for copying an object are copy constructors or copy static
factories.  Both of these take an existing object as an argument and return a copy of that object.  Both of
these can be used together, as shown below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
/* Copy Constructor */
public Language(Language language) {
    this.name = language.name;
    this.inception = language.inception;
    this.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(language.paradigms);
}

/* Copy Static Factory Method */
public static Language create(Language language) {
    return new Language(language);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Copy constructors or copy static factories are within the bounds of the Java language, making them excellent
alternatives.  Use them!
</p>
<h5>Valid uses of <code class="jarombek-header-code">clone()</code></h5>
<p>
Because the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface has been in Java since version 1.0, you
are likely to see code that uses it.  There are indeed some use cases of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
clone()</code> that are quite useful.  One of the use cases is copying an array.  Using
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> is generally the fastest way to copy an array, and is the
recommended approach<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
String[] strings = new String[2];
strings[0] = "Whats";
strings[1] = "Up";

String[] stringsCopy = strings.clone();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I’ll remind you that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> does not perform a deep copy on the
objects within a class or array.  If you mutate an object within a class or array that was cloned, the mutation
'will be observed in both the original and the copy.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
Language[] languages = new Language[2];

languages[0] = new Language("Java", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.MAY, 23),
                    List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                            Language.Paradigm.Imperative));

languages[1] = new Language("JavaScript", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.DECEMBER, 4),
                    List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                            Language.Paradigm.Imperative,
                            Language.Paradigm.Functional));

// Clone array of mutable languages
Language[] languagesCopy = languages.clone();

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languages));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languagesCopy));

// Change the date Java was created to the epoch
languagesCopy[0].setInception(LocalDate.EPOCH);

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languages));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languagesCopy));
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Before Mutation
[[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]], ...]
[[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]], ...]

# After Mutation - Both Arrays are Impacted
[[Java, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]], ...]
[[Java, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]], ...]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Yet another reason to use immutable objects!
</p>

That is all I have to share on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface, its strange
behavior, and the alternatives.  The code used for this discovery is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/

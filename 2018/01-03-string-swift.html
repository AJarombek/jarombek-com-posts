Yesterday I began to fix some bugs in my website <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf">saintsxctf.com</a>
and its corresponding native iOS and Android apps (because as we know a
codebase is never complete).  I was looking at the Swift code for my iOS app and found a bug where
I incorrectly selected a substring from a base64 encoded image.  Luckily the fix was easy to implement,
but viewing the code made me remember just how confusing the String structure is in Swift.
</p>
<p>
You would think something as simple as a string would be straightforward, but in Swift there are a
few quirks.  I wrote the code for my iOS app in Xcode 8 and Swift 3 this fall.  Since then Xcode 9 and Swift 4 were
released, making <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> a bit less confusing.  I dive
into strings in Swift 3 first and then look at what changed in Swift 4.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Swift 3">Swift 3</SectionTitle>
<p>
The first quirk of strings in Swift 3 is obvious when you try to get the length of a string.  There is
no length or count variable on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> structure.  Instead
each <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code>
property of type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">CharacterView</code>,
which is a collection of all the characters in the string<sup>1</sup>.  You can use the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code> object to get the strings size or iterate
over all the characters.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var hello = "hello my name is andy ðŸ˜º"

hello.characters.count // 23

// The characters struct is a collection of Character structs
let chars: String.CharacterView = hello.characters

// You can peform operations on the characters collection just like any other collection
chars.forEach {
    char -> Void in

    print(char)
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Like any other collection, you can perform functions such as filter, map, and sort on
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code>.  Array operations are also possible.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
// Filter out all 'a' characters
var filtered = chars.filter {$0 != "a"}

// Remove and return the last character in collection
let catEmoji = filtered.popLast() // 'ðŸ˜º'

// Convert back to a string
String(filtered)

String(filtered[6...7]) // returns 'my'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One of the difficult operations to perform on strings in Swift is getting a substring.  In other languages
its as simple as a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">substring()</code> function with two integer arguments specifying the start and end
indices.  Swift also has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">substring()</code> function but it accepts a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Range&lt;String.Index&gt;</code> structure.  This struct is constructed with
two <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structures used together with a half-open range operator
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">..&lt;</code><sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that already sounds a bit complicated.  The question is how do we get these
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structures?  We can get them by calling
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">index(String.Index, offsetBy: Int)</code> on a string<sup>3</sup>.
The following code sample gets two <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structs and then
uses them to get a substring.  Since the first argument
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">index()</code> is a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
String.Index</code> structure, I used the strings built in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
startIndex</code> property, which is the zero index of a string.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var runDescription = "I ran 2.12 miles at 6:47 pace on January 3rd, 2018"

let start: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 6)
let end: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 10)

let range: Range&lt;String.Index&gt; = start..&lt;end

runDescription.substring(with: range) // 2.12
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
So why is this <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> madness even necessary?  The
answer has to do with the way Swift characters are stored, and in particular the possible complexities
of using <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-9-2018-unicode">Unicode</a> scalars.  Characters in Swift are Unicode scalars which are characters defined in
Unicode<sup>4</sup>.  The problem is that some of these scalars are complex and can be combined into one
visible character.  The following code shows two equivalent characters, except one uses two unicode scalars
and the other uses one<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
let e1 = "\u{00EB}" // "eÌˆ"
let e2 = "\u{0065}\u{0308}" // "eÌˆ"

if e1 == e2 {
    print("They are equal!")
}

if e1.characters.count == e2.characters.count {
    print("They both have a length of 1!")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The consequence of this is an index in the internal character structure may only hold a piece of a
visible character<sup>6</sup>.  Because of this, Swift makes this complexity obvious by implementing
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> struct.  Annoying sure, but it makes sense so
that newcomers to Swift won't be tricked by the character implementation.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Swift 4">Swift 4</SectionTitle>
<p>
In Swift 4 the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code> collection was deprecated and the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> struct became a collection.  This makes
strings easier since you can perform all collection operations directly on the string object.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var hello = "hello my name is andy ðŸ˜º"

print(hello.count) // 23

hello.forEach {
    char -> Void in

    print(char)
}

// In Swift 4 since Strings are collections, we can filter directly on the String
var filtered = String(hello.filter { $0 != "a" })

filtered.removeLast() // 'ðŸ˜º'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
We still have to use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structure in Swift 4
(unfortunately for those who know the internal structure). However, we can
avoid the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Range</code> structure since strings are collections!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var runDescription = "I ran 2.12 miles at 6:47 pace on January 3rd, 2018"

let start: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 6)
let end: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 9)

let miles = runDescription[start...end] // 2.12
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Swift 4 also joins other modern languages (including JavaScripts ES6 standard) by introducing multi-line
strings in code<sup>7</sup>!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
let stats = """
    name: andy
    date: 2018-01-03
    miles: \(miles)
"""
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although the verbose <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> struct is still necessary in
Swift 4, changing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> into a collection and
supporting multi-line strings are major upgrades that make switching to Swift 4 worth it!  The code in this
discovery is up on my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/01-Jan/
1-3-Swift-String">GitHub</a>.

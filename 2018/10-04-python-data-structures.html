In my time spent researching <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-24-2018-python-data-model">Python</a>
this week I stumbled across some really interesting data structures.  Python has a vast
standard library, with many data structures that specialize in certain tasks.  It reminds me of
Java’s standard library, except that Python data structures either have their own literal syntax
or a built-in function for construction!  This discovery post looks at three data structures that I
found especially interesting.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Tuples">Tuples</SectionTitle>
<p>
Tuples are a commonly used data structure in Python.  They hold immutable records, and are
often used as immutable lists.  One thing I didn't know is that tuples support
'tuple unpacking', which spreads their contents across multiple variables.
</p>
<p>
For example, take the following tuple:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
items = ("My", "name", "is", "Andy")
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Each string record in this tuple is easily assigned to a variable using tuple unpacking:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
_my, _name, _is, _andy = items

assert _my == "My" and _name == "name" and _is == "is" and _andy == "Andy"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Tuple unpacking also has a special operator (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">*</code>), which
behaves in different ways depending on the context.  One such context is using
a tuple as a functions argument.  In this case, the tuple records are spread out as separate arguments
to the function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
print(items)   # ('My', 'name', 'is', 'Andy')
print(*items)  # My name is Andy
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The call <code className="jarombek-inline-code">print(*items)</code> is equivalent to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">print(items[0], items[1], items[2], items[3])</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">*</code> operator is also powerful when used to grab excess
items from an unpacked tuple<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
run_info = (4.32, 31, 25, 'Riverside, CT', date(2018, 9, 27))

# Tuple unpacking can also be used to grab excess items.
# Records can be grabbed from the end of a tuple...
miles, minutes, seconds, *rest = run_info

assert miles == 4.32 and minutes == 31 and seconds == 25
assert rest == ['Riverside, CT', date(2018, 9, 27)]

# ...or the start of a tuple...
*stats, location, run_date = run_info

assert stats == [4.32, 31, 25]
assert location == 'Riverside, CT' and run_date == date(2018, 9, 27)

# ...or the middle of a tuple
miles, *others, run_date = run_info

assert others == [31, 25, 'Riverside, CT']
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While Python tuple unpacking likely influenced the ES6 JavaScript destructuring syntax and spread
operator, tuple unpacking doesn’t pack the punch of its JavaScript counterpart.  In JavaScript
destructuring and spread operators are used on both objects and arrays, and are commonly utilized
to keep <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-23-2018-javascript-immutable#implicitly-immutable">
data immutable</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Memory Views">Memory Views</SectionTitle>
<p>
The Python memory view data structure is unlike any I’ve seen in other languages.  The closest
equivalent I can think of is using <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-14-2017-sorting-lists#c">
pointers in C</a>.
</p>
<p>
Memory views observe a chunk of memory that holds a data structure.  You can think of memory views
as pointers to certain memory locations of Python data structures such as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bytes</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bytearray</code>.
It is important to note that memory views do not hold any of the underlying data they observe<sup>2
</sup>.  They simply know memory locations.  Because the creation of a memory view does not copy any of
a data structures content, it is very efficient for dealing with binary data.
</p>
<p>
Memory views are only used with data structures that expose the buffer protocol.  In Python, the
buffer protocol is a way to observe the internal structure of an object<sup>3</sup>.  Both
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bytes</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">bytearray</code>
expose the buffer protocol.  The built-in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">memoryview()</code>
function is used to create a memory view.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# A byte array is a mutable binary sequence.
name_byte_array = bytearray('Andy', 'utf-8')

# Memory views take in an object that exposes the buffer protocol
memv = memoryview(name_byte_array)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Upon observing the contents of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">memv</code>, I noticed each index
in the memory view is mapped to a byte in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name_byte_array</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Analyze each byte in the memory view
assert memv[0] == 65 and memv[1] == 110 and memv[2] == 100 and memv[3] == 121
assert chr(memv[0]) == 'A' and chr(memv[1]) == 'n' and chr(memv[2]) == 'd' and chr(memv[3]) == 'y'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although it may appear that the memory view copied and holds the contents of the byte array, we know
that it simply has a pointer to the existing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name_byte_array</code>.
This is proven through a few simple tests.  First, altering data at an index in the memory view also
alters <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name_byte_array</code>.  The following code changes the
first letter to a lowercase 'a':
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
assert name_byte_array == bytearray(b'Andy')

# Convert the first byte in the memory view from capital 'A' to lowercase 'a'
memv[0] = 97

# Confirm the change to the memory view impacts the original array
assert name_byte_array == bytearray(b'andy')
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Memory views can also be sliced without copying any bytes<sup>4</sup>.  If the sliced memory view is
altered, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name_byte_array</code> will still be impacted.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Split the memory view, creating a new memory view that holds only the last two bytes
last_two_letters_memv = memv[2:]

assert bytes(last_two_letters_memv) == b'dy'

# From the split memory view, change the last letter to 'i'
last_two_letters_memv[1] = ord('i')

# Since the split memory view didn't copy any bytes, the original byte array is still impacted
assert name_byte_array == bytearray(b'andi')
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I’m not sure when I would use a memory view in my own code, but it is a really cool data structure
that enables fast, low-level data manipulation in Python.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Sets">Sets</SectionTitle>
<p>
Sets in Python are really cool, and allow you to perform all the basic set theory operations using
native Pythons operators (thanks to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-24-2018-python-data-model">
Python's MOP</a>).  Sets have their own literal syntax which matches the syntax from set theory.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Bitwise AND is used to get the Set intersection
assert s1 & s2 == {3}

# Bitwise OR is used to get the Set union
assert s1 | s2 == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# The subtraction sign is used to get the Set difference
assert s1 - s2 == {1, 2}
assert s2 - s1 == {4, 5}

# Bitwise NOT is used to get the complement of the Set intersection
assert s1 ^ s2 == {1, 2, 4, 5}

s3 = {22, 44, 66}
s4 = {22}

# Determine whether a set is a subset or superset of another set with the comparison operators

assert not s3 <= s4  # s3 is not a subset of s4
assert not s3 < s4   # s3 is not a proper subset (subset but not matching set) of s4
assert s3 >= s4      # s3 is a superset of s4
assert s3 > s4       # s3 is a proper superset (superset but not matching set) of s4
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Python has the best <code className="jarombek-inline-code">set</code> implementation I’ve seen in a language
so far.

<p>
This concludes my look at interesting Python data structures.  There are many structures
I haven't observed yet, but I already love Pythons use of built-in functions, literal syntax,
and the MOP to simplify the use of commonly leveraged data structures.

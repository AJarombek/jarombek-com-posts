For developers new to JavaScript understanding how prototypes work is quite confusing (myself included).  The construct
itself is quite simple, however those of us accustomed to class based object oriented programming have difficulty
grasping JavaScripts object model.  This discovery post attempts to clear up some confusing pieces
of JavaScript prototypes and inheritance.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is a Prototype">What is a Prototype</SectionTitle>
<p>
Most of the building blocks in JavaScript are objects.  Besides for the primitives (
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">string</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">number</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">boolean</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">undefined</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">symbol</code>) everything
in JavaScript is an object<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript has basic object types which we interact with every day in our code.  Lesser known is that
functions and arrays are also types of objects.  This makes sense if you think about it - functions and arrays
can be passed just like objects and have methods and properties just like objects.  Functions in JavaScript are
first class citizens as it relates to other objects.
</p>
<Definition word="First Class Citizen">
In programming terms an entity is a first class citizen when it has all the abilities of another entity<sup>2</sup>.
For example, in JavaScript functions are first class citizens because they are treated just like any other object
(in fact they are objects).  Functions can be instantiated, assigned to a variable, and passed as an
argument just like any other object.  They can also have properties and methods like any object.  Functions have
all the rights of other citizens in the programming language.
</Definition>
<p>
Almost everything in JavaScript is an object with first class abilities.  Every object in JavaScript has an internal
property called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code>.  While the prototype property seemed
mysterious when I first learned JavaScript it is actually very simple.  A prototype is a reference to another object.
</p>
<p>
So why would you want a JavaScript object to reference a different object?  Linking objects through prototypes allows
for a natural form of inheritance.  Inheritance in JavaScript is known as prototypal inheritance.
</p>
<Definition word="Prototypal Inheritance">
In JavaScript objects can be linked together through prototypes.  When an object is linked to a prototype, all the
exposed methods and properties on the prototype object are exposed to the base object.  Importantly the prototype
object is not copied into the base objects instance.  Instead, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]
</code> property on the base object holds a reference to the prototype object.  You can think of a prototype chain as a
singly linked list of objects.  Each object has a reference to the next object (prototype object) in the chain.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Prototype Chain">
The method by which prototypal inheritance occurs.  In JavaScript objects are linked together via the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code> property.  These linkages create a chain of objects, held
together by the prototype reference.  This chain is known as the prototype chain.
</Definition>
<p>
Lets look at some examples of natural prototype chains to get a better feel for these concepts.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Prototype Chains">Prototype Chains</SectionTitle>
<p>
For starters lets check out what prototype chain is linked to an object literal.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)</code> function is a simple way to find the prototype
of an object.  This function can be used successively to traverse the prototype chain.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const person = {
    name: "Andrew Jarombek",
    age: 23
};

// Traverse the prototype chain of an object
// person{name, age} -> Object.prototype -> null
const objPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
const objProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(objPrototype);

console.info(objPrototype);
console.info(objProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}

# The prototype of Object.prototype is null
null
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code reveals what prototype is linked to an object literal - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Object.prototype</code>.  All objects have this prototype somewhere in their chain unless explicitly defined not
to.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> defines important functions such as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">toString()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">valueOf()</code>, so
in most cases you wouldn't want to explicitly tell an object not to have <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Object.prototype</code> in its chain.  I will show you how to define an object without
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> later on.
</p>
<p>
The object above <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> in the prototype chain is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>.  The reason for having <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>
in the prototype chain is to define the top of the chain.  There should be no prototype objects for
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code>.
</p>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for an object literal:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Arrays in JavaScript are simply objects with extra functionality.  The extra functions supplied to arrays can be
found in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Array.prototype</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const array = [1,2,3,4];

// Traverse the prototype chain of an array
// [1,2,3,4] -> Array.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null
const arrayPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(array);
const arrayProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(arrayPrototype);

console.info(arrayPrototype);
console.info(arrayProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Array.prototype
[constructor: ƒ, concat: ƒ, find: ƒ, findIndex: ƒ, pop: ƒ, ...]

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for an array:
</p>

<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-9-18-array-chain.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
A function in JavaScript is a callable object.  Because of its object structure, functions also have prototype chains:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const addition = (x, y) => x + y;

// Traverse the prototype chain of a function
// {f(x, y)} -> Function.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null
const funcPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(addition);
const funcProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(funcPrototype);

console.info(funcPrototype);
console.info(funcProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Function.prototype
ƒ () { [native code] }

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for a function:

</figure>
<p>
Whether you knew it or not, all the objects used in JavaScript have a prototype chain.  There are a few different
ways you can use prototype chains to define prototypal inheritance between objects.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Prototypal Inheritance">Prototypal Inheritance</SectionTitle>
<p>
A more traditional way to define prototypes and prototypal inheritance is through functions and the ES6
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> function.  Here is the first object in my prototype
chain:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function Exercise(type) {
    this.type = type;
    this.date = Date.now();
}

const newExercise = new Exercise('Run');

// Add properties to the Exercise prototype
// All objects created with the Exercise constructor function will have these prototype elements
Exercise.prototype.distance = 3.39;
Exercise.prototype.minutes = 25;
Exercise.prototype.seconds = 46;

// Able to access items on the prototype
console.info(`${newExercise.minutes}:${newExercise.seconds}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
25:46
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> does is bind some properties to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>.  I wrote an entire
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-11-2017-js-this">discovery post</a> on
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in JavaScript since it can get quite confusing.  Calling
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> without a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">new</code>
keyword does nothing, since it binds <code className="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> to the function scope which no longer exists after the call is
completed.  However, when <code className="jarombek-inline-code">new Exercise()</code> is invoked an object is
created as a side effect.  This object contains all elements in the function scope, so the object created from
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">new Exercise()</code> contains the properties
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">date</code>.
</p>
<p>
Every object has a prototype which is often modifiable (you could always freeze a prototype - remember it is just
an object).  One way to access the prototype for modification is through the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
prototype</code> property.  In the code above the prototypes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">distance</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> properties
are defined.
</p>
<p>
The final line of the code accesses two properties on the prototype - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
minutes</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> - and prints them out.  The
notation for accessing a prototype property is the same as accessing a base object property.  What is
JavaScript doing behind the scenes to resolve variables on the prototype that are searched for on the base object
instance?
</p>
<p>
When searching for a property or method in a JavaScript object, the first thing JavaScript does is search
through the base object.  If the method or property is not found on the base
object, the search continues up the prototype chain.  The following diagram demonstrates a search JavaScript performs
for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> property.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-9-18-prototype-traverse.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Now that the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> object is understood, how can we extend this object
in a prototype chain?  Traditionally you could create another object and call the previous objects constructor
function within it.  Here is an example of a specialized exercise object that defines a running workout:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function Run(surface) {
    Exercise.call(this, 'Run');
    this.surface = surface;
}

const firstRun = new Run('Grass');

console.info(firstRun);

// Cant find minutes and seconds - the prototype is not yet hooked up
console.info(`${firstRun.minutes}:${firstRun.seconds} on ${firstRun.surface}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run {type: "Run", date: 1528548053295, surface: "Grass"}
undefined:undefined on Grass
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">call()</code> function is used in this example to explicitly bind
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run()</code> functions
scope.  Binding <code className="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> gives <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run()</code>
access to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
type</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">date</code> properties in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise()</code> function.  Right now the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> constructor
function is set as the prototype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">firstRun</code>.  However there is still an
issue which becomes apparent in the last call to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">console.info()</code>.  The
prototype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> is still not in the prototype chain of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">firstRun</code>!  Because of this the properties <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
minutes</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> are not found.
</p>
<p>
To fix the problem I called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> to add
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise.prototype</code>
into the prototype chain.  The following code sets the prototype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run.prototype
</code> (the constructor function of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>) to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise.prototype</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
Object.setPrototypeOf(Run.prototype, Exercise.prototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code>
variables are in the prototype chain.
</p>
<p>
In the examples so far every property was defined once in the prototype chain.  What would happen if a property or
method was defined in multiple levels of the prototype chain?  Looking back at the diagram that searched for the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> property, the search began at the base object and worked its way
up the prototype chain.  If there are multiple instances of a property on a chain, the first time the search finds
that property it returns its value, ignoring any properties further up the chain.  This process is known as
shadowing, since any properties further up the prototype chain are covered up by matching properties lower on the
chain<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Object.create()" isCode="true">Object.create()</SectionTitle>
<p>
In ES5 a cleaner way to define the prototype of an object was introduced that doesn’t depend on the object
creation side effects of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">new</code> operator.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create()</code> creates a new object whose prototype is passed in as
the first argument.  This function also has an optional second parameter which sets some properties on the newly
created object.  This approach is displayed below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const Exercise = {
    print: function() {
        console.info(`${this.type} ${this.miles} Miles in ${this.minutes}:${this.seconds}`)
    }
};

// Create a new object with Exercise as its prototype
// Note that using this version of Object.create() means that objects are not immutable
// if you want them to have properties
let run = Object.create(Exercise);

// Add new properties to the run object.
run.type = 'Run';
run.miles = 3.46;
run.minutes = 20;
run.seconds = 33;

run.print();

console.info(Object.getPrototypeOf(run));

// Longer more verbose implementation of Object.create(prototype, object)
// Now at least the object can be implicitly immutable
let secondRun = Object.create(Exercise, {
    type: {value: 'Run'},
    miles: {value: 4.11},
    minutes: {value: 29},
    seconds: {value: 57}
});

secondRun.print();
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run 3.46 Miles in 20:33
{print: ƒ}
Run 4.11 Miles in 29:57
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Another way to use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create()</code> is to create an
object without a prototype.  This can be done by passing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code> as the
only argument to the function like so - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create(null)</code>.  The newly
created object from this function invocation has an internal <code className="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code>
property that points to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>.  While this allows developers to easily
create an object without a prototype chain, note the drawbacks of this approach mentioned earlier.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ES6 Class">ES6 Class</SectionTitle>
<p>
ES6 introduced the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">class</code> syntax for creating objects, which confusingly
is built on top of prototypal inheritance.  The following code defines the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code> class and its <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> subclass.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
class Exercise {
    constructor(type, miles, minutes, seconds) {
        this.type = type;
        this.miles = miles;
        this.minutes = minutes;
        this.seconds = seconds;
    }

    print() {
        console.info(`${this.type} ${this.miles} Miles in ${this.minutes}:${this.seconds}`);
    }
}

class Run extends Exercise {
    constructor(miles, minutes, seconds, surface) {
        super('Run', miles, minutes, seconds);
        this.surface = surface;
    }
}

const run = new Run(1, 5, 31, 'Track');

run.print();
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run 1 Miles in 5:31
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To make it explicitly clear that classes in JavaScript are simply syntactic sugar on top of prototypes, the following
code traverses the prototype chain of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">run</code> and prints its members out.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// Go through the prototype chain of Run
const runPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(run);
const runProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(runPrototype);
const runProtoProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(runProtoPrototype);

console.info(runPrototype);
console.info(runProtoPrototype);
console.info(runProtoProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Run
Exercise {constructor: ƒ}

# Exercise
{constructor: ƒ, print: ƒ}

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Understanding prototype chains and prototypal inheritance is important when utilizing JavaScripts object oriented
features.  Often I use a more functional approach with JavaScript, so I rarely run into problems with prototypes.
However, understanding prototypes is crucial for being a well rounded JavaScript dev.

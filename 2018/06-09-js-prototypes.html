For developers new to JavaScript understanding how prototypes work is quite confusing (myself included).  The construct
itself is quite simple, however those of us accustomed to class based object oriented programming have difficulty
grasping JavaScripts object model.  This discovery post attempts to clear up some confusing pieces
of JavaScript prototypes and inheritance.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is a Prototype">What is a Prototype</SectionTitle>
<p>
Most of the building blocks in JavaScript are objects.  Besides for the primitives (
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">string</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">number</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">boolean</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">undefined</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">symbol</code>) everything
in JavaScript is an object<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript has basic object types which we interact with every day in our code.  Lesser known is that
functions and arrays are also types of objects.  This makes sense if you think about it - functions and arrays
can be passed just like objects and have methods and properties just like objects.  Functions in JavaScript are
first class citizens as it relates to other objects.
</p>
<Definition word="First Class Citizen">
In programming terms an entity is a first class citizen when it has all the abilities of another entity<sup>2</sup>.
For example, in JavaScript functions are first class citizens because they are treated just like any other object
(in fact they are objects).  Functions can be instantiated, assigned to a variable, and passed as an
argument just like any other object.  They can also have properties and methods like any object.  Functions have
all the rights of other citizens in the programming language.
</Definition>
<p>
Almost everything in JavaScript is an object with first class abilities.  Every object in JavaScript has an internal
property called <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code>.  While the prototype property seemed
mysterious when I first learned JavaScript it is actually very simple.  A prototype is a reference to another object.
</p>
<p>
So why would you want a JavaScript object to reference a different object?  Linking objects through prototypes allows
for a natural form of inheritance.  Inheritance in JavaScript is known as prototypal inheritance.
</p>
<Definition word="Prototypal Inheritance">
In JavaScript objects can be linked together through prototypes.  When an object is linked to a prototype, all the
exposed methods and properties on the prototype object are exposed to the base object.  Importantly the prototype
object is not copied into the base objects instance.  Instead, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]
</code> property on the base object holds a reference to the prototype object.  You can think of a prototype chain as a
singly linked list of objects.  Each object has a reference to the next object (prototype object) in the chain.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Prototype Chain">
The method by which prototypal inheritance occurs.  In JavaScript objects are linked together via the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code> property.  These linkages create a chain of objects, held
together by the prototype reference.  This chain is known as the prototype chain.
</Definition>
<p>
Lets look at some examples of natural prototype chains to get a better feel for these concepts.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Prototype Chains">Prototype Chains</SectionTitle>
<p>
For starters lets check out what prototype chain is linked to an object literal.  The
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)</code> function is a simple way to find the prototype
of an object.  This function can be used successively to traverse the prototype chain.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const person = {
    name: "Andrew Jarombek",
    age: 23
};

// Traverse the prototype chain of an object
// person{name, age} -> Object.prototype -> null
const objPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
const objProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(objPrototype);

console.info(objPrototype);
console.info(objProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}

# The prototype of Object.prototype is null
null
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code reveals what prototype is linked to an object literal - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Object.prototype</code>.  All objects have this prototype somewhere in their chain unless explicitly defined not
to.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> defines important functions such as
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">toString()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">valueOf()</code>, so
in most cases you wouldn't want to explicitly tell an object not to have <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Object.prototype</code> in its chain.  I will show you how to define an object without
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> later on.
</p>
<p>
The object above <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code> in the prototype chain is
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>.  The reason for having <code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>
in the prototype chain is to define the top of the chain.  There should be no prototype objects for
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.prototype</code>.
</p>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for an object literal:

</figure>
<p>
Arrays in JavaScript are simply objects with extra functionality.  The extra functions supplied to arrays can be
found in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Array.prototype</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const array = [1,2,3,4];

// Traverse the prototype chain of an array
// [1,2,3,4] -> Array.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null
const arrayPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(array);
const arrayProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(arrayPrototype);

console.info(arrayPrototype);
console.info(arrayProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Array.prototype
[constructor: ƒ, concat: ƒ, find: ƒ, findIndex: ƒ, pop: ƒ, ...]

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for an array:
</p>

<img class="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-9-18-array-chain.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
A function in JavaScript is a callable object.  Because of its object structure, functions also have prototype chains:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const addition = (x, y) => x + y;

// Traverse the prototype chain of a function
// {f(x, y)} -> Function.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null
const funcPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(addition);
const funcProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(funcPrototype);

console.info(funcPrototype);
console.info(funcProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Function.prototype
ƒ () { [native code] }

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here is a visual representation of the prototype chain for a function:

</figure>
<p>
Whether you knew it or not, all the objects used in JavaScript have a prototype chain.  There are a few different
ways you can use prototype chains to define prototypal inheritance between objects.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Prototypal Inheritance">Prototypal Inheritance</SectionTitle>
<p>
A more traditional way to define prototypes and prototypal inheritance is through functions and the ES6
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> function.  Here is the first object in my prototype
chain:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function Exercise(type) {
    this.type = type;
    this.date = Date.now();
}

const newExercise = new Exercise('Run');

// Add properties to the Exercise prototype
// All objects created with the Exercise constructor function will have these prototype elements
Exercise.prototype.distance = 3.39;
Exercise.prototype.minutes = 25;
Exercise.prototype.seconds = 46;

// Able to access items on the prototype
console.info(`${newExercise.minutes}:${newExercise.seconds}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
25:46
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> does is bind some properties to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code>.  I wrote an entire
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-11-2017-js-this">discovery post</a> on
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in JavaScript since it can get quite confusing.  Calling
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> without a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">new</code>
keyword does nothing, since it binds <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> to the function scope which no longer exists after the call is
completed.  However, when <code class="jarombek-inline-code">new Exercise()</code> is invoked an object is
created as a side effect.  This object contains all elements in the function scope, so the object created from
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">new Exercise()</code> contains the properties
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">date</code>.
</p>
<p>
Every object has a prototype which is often modifiable (you could always freeze a prototype - remember it is just
an object).  One way to access the prototype for modification is through the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
prototype</code> property.  In the code above the prototypes <code class="jarombek-inline-code">distance</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code>, and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> properties
are defined.
</p>
<p>
The final line of the code accesses two properties on the prototype - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
minutes</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> - and prints them out.  The
notation for accessing a prototype property is the same as accessing a base object property.  What is
JavaScript doing behind the scenes to resolve variables on the prototype that are searched for on the base object
instance?
</p>
<p>
When searching for a property or method in a JavaScript object, the first thing JavaScript does is search
through the base object.  If the method or property is not found on the base
object, the search continues up the prototype chain.  The following diagram demonstrates a search JavaScript performs
for the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> property.
</p>
<figure>
<img class="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-9-18-prototype-traverse.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Now that the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> object is understood, how can we extend this object
in a prototype chain?  Traditionally you could create another object and call the previous objects constructor
function within it.  Here is an example of a specialized exercise object that defines a running workout:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
function Run(surface) {
    Exercise.call(this, 'Run');
    this.surface = surface;
}

const firstRun = new Run('Grass');

console.info(firstRun);

// Cant find minutes and seconds - the prototype is not yet hooked up
console.info(`${firstRun.minutes}:${firstRun.seconds} on ${firstRun.surface}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run {type: "Run", date: 1528548053295, surface: "Grass"}
undefined:undefined on Grass
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">call()</code> function is used in this example to explicitly bind
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run()</code> functions
scope.  Binding <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> gives <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run()</code>
access to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
type</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">date</code> properties in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise()</code> function.  Right now the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise()</code> constructor
function is set as the prototype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">firstRun</code>.  However there is still an
issue which becomes apparent in the last call to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">console.info()</code>.  The
prototype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> is still not in the prototype chain of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">firstRun</code>!  Because of this the properties <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
minutes</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code> are not found.
</p>
<p>
To fix the problem I called <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> to add
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise.prototype</code>
into the prototype chain.  The following code sets the prototype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run.prototype
</code> (the constructor function of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>) to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise.prototype</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
Object.setPrototypeOf(Run.prototype, Exercise.prototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">seconds</code>
variables are in the prototype chain.
</p>
<p>
In the examples so far every property was defined once in the prototype chain.  What would happen if a property or
method was defined in multiple levels of the prototype chain?  Looking back at the diagram that searched for the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">minutes</code> property, the search began at the base object and worked its way
up the prototype chain.  If there are multiple instances of a property on a chain, the first time the search finds
that property it returns its value, ignoring any properties further up the chain.  This process is known as
shadowing, since any properties further up the prototype chain are covered up by matching properties lower on the
chain<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Object.create()" isCode="true">Object.create()</SectionTitle>
<p>
In ES5 a cleaner way to define the prototype of an object was introduced that doesn’t depend on the object
creation side effects of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">new</code> operator.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create()</code> creates a new object whose prototype is passed in as
the first argument.  This function also has an optional second parameter which sets some properties on the newly
created object.  This approach is displayed below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const Exercise = {
    print: function() {
        console.info(`${this.type} ${this.miles} Miles in ${this.minutes}:${this.seconds}`)
    }
};

// Create a new object with Exercise as its prototype
// Note that using this version of Object.create() means that objects are not immutable
// if you want them to have properties
let run = Object.create(Exercise);

// Add new properties to the run object.
run.type = 'Run';
run.miles = 3.46;
run.minutes = 20;
run.seconds = 33;

run.print();

console.info(Object.getPrototypeOf(run));

// Longer more verbose implementation of Object.create(prototype, object)
// Now at least the object can be implicitly immutable
let secondRun = Object.create(Exercise, {
    type: {value: 'Run'},
    miles: {value: 4.11},
    minutes: {value: 29},
    seconds: {value: 57}
});

secondRun.print();
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run 3.46 Miles in 20:33
{print: ƒ}
Run 4.11 Miles in 29:57
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Another way to use <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create()</code> is to create an
object without a prototype.  This can be done by passing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code> as the
only argument to the function like so - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object.create(null)</code>.  The newly
created object from this function invocation has an internal <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[[Prototype]]</code>
property that points to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code>.  While this allows developers to easily
create an object without a prototype chain, note the drawbacks of this approach mentioned earlier.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ES6 Class">ES6 Class</SectionTitle>
<p>
ES6 introduced the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">class</code> syntax for creating objects, which confusingly
is built on top of prototypal inheritance.  The following code defines the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code> class and its <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> subclass.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
class Exercise {
    constructor(type, miles, minutes, seconds) {
        this.type = type;
        this.miles = miles;
        this.minutes = minutes;
        this.seconds = seconds;
    }

    print() {
        console.info(`${this.type} ${this.miles} Miles in ${this.minutes}:${this.seconds}`);
    }
}

class Run extends Exercise {
    constructor(miles, minutes, seconds, surface) {
        super('Run', miles, minutes, seconds);
        this.surface = surface;
    }
}

const run = new Run(1, 5, 31, 'Track');

run.print();
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Run 1 Miles in 5:31
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To make it explicitly clear that classes in JavaScript are simply syntactic sugar on top of prototypes, the following
code traverses the prototype chain of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">run</code> and prints its members out.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// Go through the prototype chain of Run
const runPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(run);
const runProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(runPrototype);
const runProtoProtoPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(runProtoPrototype);

console.info(runPrototype);
console.info(runProtoPrototype);
console.info(runProtoProtoPrototype);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Run
Exercise {constructor: ƒ}

# Exercise
{constructor: ƒ, print: ƒ}

# Object.prototype
{constructor: ƒ, hasOwnProperty: ƒ, isPrototypeOf: ƒ, propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ, ...}
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Understanding prototype chains and prototypal inheritance is important when utilizing JavaScripts object oriented
features.  Often I use a more functional approach with JavaScript, so I rarely run into problems with prototypes.
However, understanding prototypes is crucial for being a well rounded JavaScript dev.

This is part II of my Oracle advanced query discovery.  You can check out
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions/blob/master/Discoveries/2018/
03-Mar/3-18-Oracle-Adv-I/View">part I</a> as well!  The two clauses I will look at in this
discovery are <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code>.  The table I am running queries against is
called <code class="jarombek-inline-code">code_written</code>
and it stores data about how many lines of code I wrote in each language over the years.
The data is real too, I actually wrote the amount of code listed!
</p>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause allows you to access columns in a row
like a multidimensional array.  The calculations you can perform on
this array are similar to those seen in a spreadsheet application such as Excel<sup>1</sup>.
The reason for including the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause in Oracle was that
users would often copy and paste SQL query results into a spreadsheet and then manipulate
the data from there.  Not you can perform these manipulations in native SQL.
</p>
<p>
The following query is a basic example using the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code>
clause.  I have often figured these lines written statistics are not
quite accurate representations of time spent writing code in each language.  For example, Java is
very verbose and I could say I wrote 200 lines of code when all I did was create a simple POJO.
Meanwhile, Python has very concise syntax and I often make complex programs
in less than 100 lines of code.  I use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause
to adjust the lines written numbers for both Java and Python based on their verbosity.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT year, language, lines_written
  FROM code_written
MODEL
PARTITION BY (year)
DIMENSION BY (language)
MEASURES (lines lines_written) (
    lines_written['Java'] = ROUND(lines_written['Java'] * 0.8),
    lines_written['Python'] = ROUND(lines_written['Python'] * 1.25)
)
ORDER BY lines_written DESC NULLS LAST;

<p>
As you can see from the results, now Swift is listed as the language with the most lines written in 2017.
</p>
<p>
Besides for the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause, the three other important
clauses here are <code class="jarombek-inline-code">PARTITION BY</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">DIMENSION BY</code>, and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MEASURES</code>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">PARTITION BY</code> defines groupings in the result set.  the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause will then perform operations on each of these
groupings<sup>2</sup>.  In my query, I partition by the year so
that rules defined later will be applied to each year.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">DIMENSION BY</code> identifies each cell in the partition.
These cells make up one element in the multidimensional array.  In my
example, I dimension by language so that each cell is a language.  For instance I pick an index
in the array with the strings <code class="jarombek-inline-code">'Java'</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">'Python'</code>.  The array created from this partition only has
one dimension, but that doesn't have to be the case.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">MEASURES</code> defines what type will be located in each cell and
the name of the array<sup>3</sup>.  In the previous query, I
said that each cell will contain a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">lines</code> element and the
array will be named <code class="jarombek-inline-code">lines_written</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another really cool thing about the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause is that
you can loop through the array of cells with a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">FOR</code>
loop<sup>4</sup>.  You can then get the current value within the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">FOR</code>
loop with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">CURRENTV()</code> function.  The
following queries get the monthly line totals for each language.  Although they all return the same
result, you can follow the comments to see how each optimizes the previous query.

Now onto probably the coolest thing I have seen in Oracle so far: the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code> clause!  You can use this clause to rotate
rows into columns!  You must use an aggregate function with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code> clause.  The following query rotates the row
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">year</code> into columns:

<CodeSnippet language="SQL">

  SELECT
    year,
    language,
    lines

Now that is awesome!  This is exactly the layout for this data that I would want in an Excel
spreadsheet and it was generated in pure SQL!  I can improve this query result by displaying the total
number of lines for each language with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">GROUP BY ROLLUP</code>
clause and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">GROUPING()</code> function.

Notice that I created a table from the result of this query.  I did this so I can use the

Next time I create an Oracle discovery I will look at some PL/SQL!  I'm sure I will come back to these
discoveries when I need to use similar SQL queries in the future!  All the code is up on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions/blob/master/Discoveries/2018/03-Mar/

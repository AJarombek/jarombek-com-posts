Ever since I first heard about infrastructure as code (IaC) and Terraform 9 months ago, I’ve
been intrigued by what the fuss is all about.  I always developed software and nothing more.
Digging through Linux or setting up email servers are things I have nightmares about.  When told
that learning operations is important for developers and warned of the combination of developer and
operations (DevOps), I kindly said "no thank you, operations are not for me."
</p>
<p>
With my first website <a href="https://www.saintsxctf.com/">SaintsXCTF</a>, I was exposed to the
world of setting up linux servers to host websites.  I set up an Apache web server with DNS
routing and stumbled through a Postfix mail transferring agent.  I felt very accomplished by all
that, but quickly shifted my focus back to developing software.  After all, writing code is what
I love to do!
</p>
<p>
With my second website (which you are currently viewing) I started working in the cloud with AWS.
I didn't enjoy my time clicking through the AWS UI, picking EC2 instances to start up and configuring
S3 buckets.  Clicking through a website to configure cloud infrastructure isn't fun, writing code is.
If only I could configure all my infrastructure by writing code!
</p>
<p>
With Terraform writing code for cloud infrastructure is a reality.  I never thought I could have fun
doing operations work, but now Terraform allows me to!  No longer
will I stumble through a cloud UI to set up a website.  Infrastructure as code is not a
completely new concept, however it is one that managed to evade me until now.  This post is my
first baby steps with IaC and Terraform.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is Terraform?">What is Terraform?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Terraform is part of the DevOps movement, which describes the combination of software
development and operations.  Terraform in particular allows developers to write infrastructure as code.
</p>
<Definition word="DevOps">
Software developers create application software, while operations teams work on managing the hardware
infrastructure that applications sit upon.  As new technologies such as cloud hosting and
infrastructure as code emerged, the lines between developer and operations blurred.  Often these days
the development and operations roles are merged, since in both cases the job involves writing code!
</Definition>
<Definition word="Infrastructure as Code (IaC)">
Traditionally, managing infrastructure meant setting up physical servers. With the cloud, servers
are part of a paid subscription model.  Companies no longer adjust physical servers to fit the
scaling needs of a company.  Cloud infrastructure is declared in new ways - such as
code written in a programming language.  IaC uses scripts to run and
provision cloud infrastructure instantly.  For example, a script can set up a linux machine with
a web server.
</Definition>
<p>
Terraform is a server provisioning tool - meaning it enables servers, databases, load balancers,
and more to be written as code<sup>1</sup>.  IaC can be fully documented and versioned.  Just
looking at a Terraform script declaratively outlines an applications infrastructure needs.
Reverting to a previous infrastructure simply requires pulling an old tag or different branch from
version control and executing the Terraform script.  Terraform is pleasant and fun compared
to navigating a cloud providers UI!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Creating a Hello World Web Server with Terraform">Creating a Hello World Web Server with Terraform</SectionTitle>
<p>
Terraform scripts are written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which is a declarative
language<sup>2</sup>.  When HashiCorp created Terraform, they thought of using JSON for IaC.
  However, certain JSON limitations (such as the inability to write comments) caused them to create
their own configuration language<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
To create a "hello world" web server in Terraform, I wrote one file with all the IaC configuration.
The configuration file creates a new EC2 instance to host a web server.  Let’s spend the following
 sections breaking down the code in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/
blob/master/terraform/helloworld/server.tf">server.tf</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Input Variables">Input Variables</SectionTitle>
<p>
The configuration begins with a couple variable definitions:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
variable "region" {
  description = "The region in AWS for the EC2 Instance"
  default = "us-east-1"
  type = "string"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The instance type (size of the instance)"
  default = "t2.micro"
}

variable "ami" {
  description = "The Amazon Machine Image for the instance"
  default = "ami-04169656fea786776"
}

variable "server_port" {
  description = "The server port to use for the basic web server"
  default = 8080
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Variables are used as inputs in terraform scripts for flexibility across executions.
Variables are defined with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">variable</code> keyword
followed by a block of configuration items.
</p>
<p>
The first variable <code class="jarombek-inline-code">region</code> defines the AWS region, which
is a geographic area to host cloud components<sup>4</sup>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
region</code> has three pieces of configuration - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">description
</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">default</code>, and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
type</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">description</code> documents an input variable both in code
and when using the Terraform CLI<sup>5</sup>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">default</code>
gives input variables a value to fall back on if one isn't provided.  There are a couple ways
to provide input variables in Terraform, all which utilize command line flags or environment
variables.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> explicitly binds variables to a type.
If type isn't specified in a variable configuration, HCL will implicitly guess what the type is.
</p>
<p>
The other three variables also assist in making the Terraform configuration dynamic.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">instance_type</code> specifies the EC2 instance type.  Each
instance type has a different configuration of resources, such as CPU and memory.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">instance_type</code> defaults to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">t2.micro</code>, which exists on Amazon’s free tier of instances.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">ami</code> determines the Amazon Machine Image for an EC2
instance. An AMI is a blueprint for EC2 instances (virtual machines), and in the Terraform script
I specified one of the official Ubuntu AMIs as the default<sup>6,7</sup>.  Finally,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">server_port</code> determines the port to host the web server.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Providers">Providers</SectionTitle>
<p>
Once input variables are declared, a service provider for the script is specified.  My cloud
provider is AWS, and the region to build infrastructure is determined by an input variable.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Input variables are accessed as properties on <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code>.  HCL
supports string interpolation, so the values of variables can be written inside strings.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Resources">Resources</SectionTitle>
<p>
Now we can pick apart the meat of Terraform scripts - resources.  Resources are the pieces of
infrastructure on your provider.  I created three resources - an EC2 instance, an elastic IP
address, and an AWS security group.  First let’s look at the EC2 instance resource.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_instance" "tf-basic-instance" {
  ami = "${var.ami}"
  instance_type = "${var.instance_type}"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.instance_security.id}"]

  # Define user_data which will execute while the instance is booting up
  user_data = <<-EOF
                #!/bin/bash
                echo "Hello From Terraform" > index.html
                nohup busybox httpd -f -p "${var.server_port}" &
                EOF

  tags {
    Name = "tf-basic-instance"
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Resources follow a similar syntax to variables and providers:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "&lt;resource-type&gt;" "&lt;user-defined-resource-name&gt;" {
  &lt;configuration items&gt;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The AMI and instance type of the EC2 instance are defined in input variables.  The
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">tags</code> code block
displays a name for the instance in the AWS UI<sup>8</sup>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
user_data</code> is interesting because any statements written in its body are executed when
the instance starts up.  In my config, a batch script executes and starts a basic web server.
</p>
<p>
In order for an EC2 instance to accept web traffic, a security group is specified to accept incoming
traffic across all IP addresses<sup>9</sup>.  You will recognize that the port specified for
incoming traffic matches the web servers port.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_security_group" "instance_security" {
  name = "tf-basic-instance"

  # Handle incomming traffic
  ingress {
    from_port = "${var.server_port}"
    to_port = "${var.server_port}"
    protocol = "tcp"

    # IP Range - allow all incomming IP addresses
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The last resource I made for the simple web server was an elastic IP address.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_eip" "tf-instance-ip" {
  # Map the elastic IP address to the EC2 instance
  instance = "${aws_instance.tf-basic-instance.id}"

  # You can define explicit dependencies to make sure terraform processes resources in order,
  # However terraform handles dependencies behind the scenes implicitly.  So this is redundant.
  depends_on = ["aws_instance.tf-basic-instance"]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Elastic IP addresses are static while EC2 IP addresses change when an instance is torn down.
Instead of accessing an EC2 instance from the instances IP address, you can go through the elastic
IP address.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say an elastic IP is 60.0.0.1 and an EC2 instance IP is 60.0.0.2.  Both IPs are available
to access the EC2 instance.  What would happen if the EC2 instance went down or was torn down by
Terraform?  In this case the IP address would probably change.  Once the EC2 instance is back
online, the IP is changed to 60.0.0.3.  If all your web server DNS entries were mapped to 60.0.0.2,
you would have to reconfigure them.  However, the elastic IP address never changed, so the new
EC2 instance is still accessible through 60.0.0.1.  Elastic IPs mask failures of EC2 instances
<sup>10</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Output Variables</SectionTitle>
<p>
The final piece of the Terraform script defines output variables.  Once a Terraform script
executes, output variables are displayed and stored for future access.  In general, output
variables are important pieces of data that script users need access to - such as the generated
EC2 IP address.
</p>
<p>
In my Terraform script I defined two output variables - the EC2 instance IP address and the elastic
IP address.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
output "public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.tf-basic-instance.public_ip}"
}

output "elastic_ip" {
  value = "${aws_eip.tf-instance-ip.public_ip}"
}
</CodeSnippet>

<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Building Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
Executing Terraform scripts is easy.  Using the Terraform CLI, the following four commands are used:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Initialize a working directory for Terraform
terraform init

# Plan out what changes Terraform will make when executed
terraform plan

# Execute the Terraform files
terraform apply

# Destroy all Infrastructure created with Terraform
terraform destroy
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">terraform init</code> is mandatory in order to designate a working
directory for Terraform.  A crucial part of the working directory is the Terraform state file, which
maintains the current infrastructure deployed.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">terraform plan</code> shows what changes Terraform will make to
your infrastructure, and executing a Terraform script is done with
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">terraform apply</code>.  After running
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">terraform apply</code>, I navigated to the AWS console and saw
the EC2 instance up and running:

Using the elastic IP, I viewed the web server in my browser.
</p>

<p>
With just a few simple commands, I created a web server on AWS!

Using Terraform and IaC makes building cloud infrastructure fun!  I'm excited to learn more about
Terraform and different DevOps practices.  The code for this discovery post along with my other
DevOps adventures is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/tree/master/

While reading a book on Groovy recently I came across two different definitions that apply to
the languages type system.  The first states that Groovy is an optionally typed language.
Optional typing in Groovy allows certain variables defined without a type (using the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">def</code> keyword) and others with a type similar to Java.
The second definition given to Groovy's type system is that it is dynamically typed.  In the
past I always associated dynamic typing with not having to explicitly declare types in code (in
languages like Python and JavaScript).  So how can Groovy have dynamic typing along with
optional type declarations?  To answer these questions I had to dig
deeper into programming languages type system and sharpen up my definitions of dynamic and
static typing.

<SectionTitle title="Dynamic & Static Typing">Dynamic & Static Typing</SectionTitle>
<p>
As previously mentioned, I used to associate dynamic typing with a lack of type definitions.  I
likely made this association because languages that don't declare types in code are often
dynamically typed - such as JavaScript and Python.  While both JavaScript and Python are
dynamically typed, the meaning of dynamic typing is less about existence of type definitions and
more about when types are enforced.

A language is dynamically typed when types are enforced at runtime.  Dynamic typing is a form
of type safety - making sure there are no discrepancies between expected types and actual
types in the language<sup>1</sup>.  Dynamic typed languages enforce type safety dynamically
at runtime.  Dynamically typed languages often syntactically lack type definitions<sup>2</sup>.

Static Typing
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A language that is statically typed enforces types at compile time and runtime.  The ability
to enforce types at compile time allows a language to safely fail the compilation stage when
type definitions mismatch their values.  Knowing types early on gives the compiler enough
knowledge to optimize code even further based on the type<sup>3</sup>.  Languages that are
statically typed are generally categorized as safer and faster, albeit with less flexibility
and more up front work when building code due to syntactic type definitions.

<p>
Quickly before moving further, here is a refresher of what I mean by types and type safety:
</p>
<Definition word="Type">
A type consists of certain characteristics that describe a piece of data<sup>4</sup>.  The
characteristics alter how the compiler/interpreter handles the data's value<sup>5</sup>.  Developers
can perform different operations with a value depending of the characteristics defined in its type.
Examples of data types are integers and objects (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">int</code> in
Java and instances of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> in Groovy/Java).
</Definition>
<Definition word="Type Safety">
Type safety defines the handling of type errors and type mismatches in a programming language.
Enforcement of type safety can occur at compile time or runtime.  An example of a compile time
type safety check in a statically typed language is failing the compilation stage if an
object defined as type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is given a value of type
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code>.  Type safety in a dynamic programming language
is handled at runtime, which is arguably a less elegant solution then failing before the code gets
a chance to execute.
</Definition>
<p>
Since Groovy is dynamically typed, it enforces type safety at runtime instead of compile time.
In some of the definitions I've seen about dynamic typing, dynamically typed languages are said
to lack type definitions.  However, in Groovy we know that type definitions are available for use
similar to Java.  The difference between using type definitions in Groovy and Java is enforcement
at runtime in Groovy and enforcement at both compile time and runtime in Java.  This makes Groovy
dynamically typed and Java statically typed.
</p>
<p>
The following code and comments show the unique behavior of dynamically typed Groovy:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
// The following code will compile yet fail at runtime since casting an
// ArrayList to an Integer is not valid
Integer hello = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
println hello

// Interestingly the same code will pass if you use a String type,
// casting an ArrayList to a String
String helloString = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
println helloString
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Groovy's ability to use type definitions leads to the definition of optionally typed.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Optionally Typed">Optionally Typed</SectionTitle>
<p>
As explored in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-2-2018-groovy-basics-pt1">first Groovy
discovery</a> the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">def</code> keyword actually just assigns a
value to type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">def</code> does not define a value without a type - the type is
just not explicitly declared.  Everything in Groovy is an object, so everything has a type at
runtime<sup>6</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The phrase "optionally typed" comes from the fact that syntactically declaring types in code is
optional in Groovy.  Developers can use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">def</code>
keyword, allowing for implicit type declarations.  Let's officially define optional typing and
show some example Groovy code.
</p>
<Definition word="Optionally Typed">
Optional typing is the syntactic ability to leave out type definitions.  All values still have
types, however they can be implicitly assigned.
</Definition>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
// When a type is not specified, the type is Object.
// It does not mean there is no type
def hiWorld = "Hello World"

assert hiWorld instanceof Object
assert hiWorld instanceof String
</CodeSnippet>

If you are like me you probably also heard the terms strong and weak typing (loosely typing)
before.  I've often heard strong typing interchanged with static typing (and weak typing
interchanged with dynamic typing).  Unfortunately these definitions are incorrect, along with many
of the textbooks and blog entries you hear the terms used in.  Even I have used the terms
incorrectly numerous times.
</p>
<p>
There is no real correct definition for strict and weak typing.  It is often agreed upon that
the terms should not be used due to the confusion they cause<sup>7</sup>.  I won't go into the
many definitions here, but you can read more about the history of the terms and their various uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">elsewhere</a>.

<SectionTitle title="Duck Typing">Duck Typing</SectionTitle>
<p>
A common use of dynamically typed languages is duck typing.
</p>
<Definition word="Duck Typing">
The general phrase that applies to duck typing is "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a
duck, then it must be a duck<sup>8</sup>."  At its core this phrase is a conditional statement.
If a value
is able to quack, then the value must be a duck.  In other words, if a values type definition has
a method <code class="jarombek-inline-code">quack()</code>, then we can safely assume that it is
an instance of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Duck</code> or another compatible object with a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">quack()</code> method.  Bringing it all together, if an object
has the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">quack()</code> method it can be treated as a duck
without even checking the type definition at all.
</Definition>
<p>
The following code takes advantage of Groovy's dynamic type system and duck typing.  The value
passed to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">outputAll()</code> can be of any type with the
assumption that its type definition has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">each()</code> method.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
def static outputAll(item) {
  def str = "["
  item.each {
    str += "${it}"
  }
  str += "]"
  return str
}

def outputList = outputAll([1,2,3,4,5])
def outputMap = outputAll([name:'Andy', age:'23'])

println outputMap
println outputList
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
[name=Andyage=23]
[12345]
</CodeSnippet>

Groovy is unique because it allows for static typing with the use of annotations.  I explored the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">@TypeChecked</code> annotation in my
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-4-2018-groovy-basics-pt2">second Groovy discovery</a> and
its ability to enable static typing on methods.  Groovy can even take things to the next level
with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@CompileStatic</code> annotation.  This annotation
takes away even more of Groovy's dynamic language features.  These annotations deserve an article
of their own and I still don't understand them fully, but they seem to give even more flexibility
to the Groovy programmer.

It turns out I really didn't know my definitions of dynamic and static typing at all.  A future
discovery can explore the differences between dynamic programming languages
and static programming languages (these topics are different than static and dynamic 
<strong>typing</strong> but related). I can also look into static typing with Groovy.  I'm really
happy with the new knowledge I gained from the research for this post and look forward to reading
more about Groovy soon.

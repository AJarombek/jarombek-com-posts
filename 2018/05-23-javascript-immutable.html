The benefits of keeping data immutable while programming is well documented.  Immutable data is side effect free,
predictable, and easy to test.   While immutability is a strict requirement in the functional paradigm, for other
paradigms it is simply a recommendation.  In a language like JavaScript that supports multiple
paradigms, some code does <strong>not</strong> keep data immutable.  I am guilty of it too.
</p>
<p>
All the code I write these days has immutability in mind.  This post goes over the basics of preventing object
mutations in JavaScript and how ES6+ features simplify the task.
</p>
<Definition word="Immutable">
Something that is immutable can't be changed.  In a programming language data is immutable when the value of
an object or primitive can't be altered.
</Definition>
<SectionTitle title="Constant vs Immutable">Constant vs. Immutable</SectionTitle>
<p>
One common confusion with immutability in JavaScript revolves around the new <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
const</code> keyword introduced in ES6.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">const</code> declares a
constant variable, one that can't change once its assigned.  The trick is that constant in JavaScript
doesn't mean that the referenced object is immutable.  You can mutate the referenced object all you want.
What you can't do is change the reference to point to a different object or primitive.
</p>
<p>
In JavaScript a constant variable is bound to a primitive type or a reference to an object. All primitives in
JavaScript are immutable, so a constant primitive is effectively immutable.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
/* Const can't be rebound to a new primitive or object */
const name = 'Andy';

/* Throws TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. */
// name = 'Joe';

/* Let can be bound to a new object or primitive */
let othername = 'Andy';
othername = 'Joe';

console.info(othername);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Joe
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Objects are not necessarily immutable.  More care must be taken to avoid mutating an object.  Here is an
example of a constant variable referencing an array.  Note that the array can mutate:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const names = ["Andrew", "Jarombek"];
names[0] = "Joe";

console.info(`Names After Modification: ${names}`);

/* Throws TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. */
// names = ["Joe", "Jarombek"];

// Freezing the names array makes it read only
Object.freeze(names);

names[0] = "Tom";
console.info(`Names After Frozen: ${names}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Names After Modification: Joe,Jarombek
Names After Frozen: Joe,Jarombek
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
More on that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()</code> function shortly.  For now simply note that it
prevents the mutation of an object!
</p>
<p>
Now that the difference between constant and immutable is clear, it is time to look at approaches for immutability in
JavaScript.  There are two common approaches - making code explicitly immutable or just implicitly immutable.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Explicitly Immutable">Explicitly Immutable</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Explicitly Immutable">
When a piece of data is clearly defined as being immutable.  When a variable is explicitly immutable
it is impossible to mutate its value even if you try.
</Definition>
<p>
In JavaScript all objects have internal attributes determining which actions can be performed on them<sup>1</sup>.
One of these internal attributes is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Extensible</code>, which determines whether
an object can be modified.  Modifying an object entails removing or adding a property.  By default,
objects in JavaScript are extensible, meaning programmers are free to modify them.
</p>
<p>
One way to set the internal <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Extensible</code> attribute to false is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.seal()</code>.  Once an object is passed to this function it can
no longer be modified.  Note that sealing is not the same as making an object immutable.  You can still mutate
existing properties:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const cat = {
    breed: "Russian Blue",
    name: "Lily"
};

Object.seal(cat);

const isSealed = Object.isSealed(cat);
console.info(`Is Cat Sealed: ${isSealed}`);

/* Sealed objects allow for properties to be modified... */
cat.name = "Dotty";

/* ...But they do not allow for new properties to be added... */
cat.owner = "Andy";

/* ...or deleted */
delete cat.name;

console.info(`Sealed Cat After Modification: ${JSON.stringify(cat)}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Is Cat Sealed: true
Sealed Cat After Modification: {"breed":"Russian Blue","name":"Dotty"}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Sealing an object makes it explicitly un-modifiable.  This is nice, however we are looking for explicit
immutability.  To achieve this goal, we can use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const person = {
    name: "Andy",
    hometown: {
        city: "Riverside",
        state: "Connecticut",
        country: "USA"
    }
};

Object.freeze(person);

const isFrozen = Object.isFrozen(person);
console.info(`Is Person Frozen: ${isFrozen}`);

// Object is frozen, this mutation has no effect
person.name = "Joe";

// Freezing is shallow, so nested objects can be mutated!
person.hometown.country = "Canada";

console.info(person);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Is Person Frozen: true
{
    name: 'Andy',
    hometown: {
        city: 'Riverside',
        state: 'Connecticut',
        country: 'Canada'
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Once an object is frozen none of its properties can be modified.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()
</code> explicitly states the object passed as an argument is immutable.
</p>
<p>
There is a catch with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()</code>.  The freeze operation is shallow,
meaning only direct properties on the object are restricted from mutating.  Nested objects properties are not
frozen.  This is why in the above code the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">country</code> property is able to
mutate.  Code that performs a deep freeze is a bit more involved<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Implicitly Immutable">Implicitly Immutable</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Implicitly Immutable">
When something is implicit it is not directly said or expressed.  Instead its implied and known to be true.  When data is
implicitly immutable in a programming language it is never strictly declared as being immutable.  However, as a
developer its implied that the data is immutable because other code doesn't mutate it.  Its known to be immutable.
</Definition>
<p>
ES6 introduced two new ways to keep data implicitly immutable.  One is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Object.assign()</code> and the other is the spread operator (the recommended approach).  I demonstrate both
on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">person</code> object below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const person = {
    name: "Andy",
    hometown: {
        city: "Riverside",
        state: "Connecticut",
        country: "USA"
    }
};

const changedNamePerson = {
    ...person,
    name: "Joe"
};

console.info(`The Original Person: ${JSON.stringify(person)}`);
console.info(`The New Person: ${JSON.stringify(changedNamePerson)}`);

const anotherNewPerson = Object.assign({}, changedNamePerson, {name: "Tom"});

console.info(`The New Person: ${JSON.stringify(changedNamePerson)}`);
console.info(`The New(er) Person: ${JSON.stringify(anotherNewPerson)}`);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>

The Original Person: {"name":"Andy","hometown":{"city":"Riverside","state":"Connecticut","country":"USA"}}
The New Person: {"name":"Joe","hometown":{"city":"Riverside","state":"Connecticut","country":"USA"}}

The New Person: {"name":"Joe","hometown":{"city":"Riverside","state":"Connecticut","country":"USA"}}
The New(er) Person: {"name":"Tom","hometown":{"city":"Riverside","state":"Connecticut","country":"USA"}}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The spread operator (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">...</code>) makes a copy of every property on an original
object (or array) and spreads them out into a new object (or array).  It performs the necessary copy to keep
property data immutable.  Note that just like <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()</code>, the spread
operator makes a shallow copy.  If you wanted to make a deep copy the code is a bit more involved.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.assign()</code> is a bit more verbose.  It creates a copy of an object,
where the first parameter is the target object upon which the new object is built.  The rest of the parameters are
the sources objects, which are copied into the target object.  Although
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.assign()</code> gets the job done, the spread operator is much more
concise (and the recommended approach).
</p>
<p>
One important note before moving on.  In the examples above the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>
property is defined twice in the target object.  In JavaScript this is okay.  In the case of a property name conflict the 
second property value overwrites the first property value.  Property conflict resolution helps give a copied
object's property a new value without mutating the existing property!
</p>
<p>
The following two sections show some basic operations on objects and arrays to keep them immutable.
These operations follow the "implicitly immutable" approach.  Note the extensive use of ES6+ features such as the
spread operator, destructuring, and functional methods.

I know this post is centered around JavaScript, but this year I also spent time working in
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-8-2018-typescript">TypeScript</a> for the <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/mar-17-2018-mean-stack-prototype">Angular framework</a>.  TypeScript has a really cool way to define
explicitly immutable properties and variables with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">readonly</code> keyword.
This keyword makes properties immutable<sup>3</sup>!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
type Time = {
    readonly minutes: number;
    readonly seconds: number;
}

class Run {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly date = Date.now();
    readonly miles: number;
    readonly time: Time;

    constructor(name: string, miles: number, time: Time) {
        this.name = name;
        this.miles = miles;
        this.time = time;
    }
}

const todaysRun = new Run(
        "Beach Run",
        3.26,
        {minutes: 25, seconds: 56}
    );

console.info(todaysRun);

// You can't change the name property because it is read only
// todaysRun.name = "Trail Run";

Pretty cool right?  Too bad there isn't any similar syntax in JavaScript that can be defined on property definitions.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
We all know that mutability is bad and leads to fragile code.  I recently worked on an existing codebase in Java
that contained mutable data and it was a nightmare.  A central data structure to the application was mutated
by a function call on a variable that didn't even match the one the data structure was bound to!  It was confusing
to say the least.
</p>
<p>
One question that arises from this post is which is better - implicit or explicit immutability.  I would say it
depends.  In JavaScript the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.freeze()</code> approach to explicit
immutability is not very safe.  Since the object is not frozen when it is initialized there are points in time
before its frozen.  This is dangerous.  The TypeScript approach to explicit immutability is much better since
it is applied to the property definitions.
</p>
<p>
The upside to explicit immutability is that its obvious to other developers (and your future self) that
properties can't be mutated.  The fact that attempts to mutate an object will fail is a very safe approach.
</p>
<p>
However if you know what you're doing implicit immutability is good enough.  With implicit immutability code is dependable and
side effect free!

The thing that really intrigued me during my Groovy <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jul-2-2018-groovy-basics-pt1">first</a> <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jul-4-2018-groovy-basics-pt2">impressions</a> posts were closures.  Closures are Groovy objects with
similarities to Java lambda functions and JavaScript arrow functions (among others).  While
enclosed in an object, closures behave like a method which can be invoked and passed arguments.
Closures can also be assigned to variables and passed as arguments (they are objects after all).
In this post I will look at the basic behavior of closures and compare them to similar constructs
in other languages (Java, JavaScript, & Swift).
</p>
<h5>What is a Groovy Closure?</h5>
<p>
Speaking about closures often causes confusion since its definition varies across languages.  For
example, in JavaScript a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-9-2017-js-closure-modules">closure
</a> describes the ability of a function to remember its lexical scope (the scope in which it was
defined in code) even when it’s invoked outside its lexical scope.  JavaScript’s closure definition
is different than Groovy’s, although in Groovy closures remember their lexical scope as well<sup>1
</sup>.  To reduce confusion <strong>birthday context</strong> is the Groovy idiom for a JavaScript
closure.
</p>
<p>
Closures in Groovy are objects containing code to be executed.  Their syntax starts with a curly
brace and ends with a curly brace (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">{ … }</code>).  Here is a
very basic closure that prints out a list:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
def list = ["Tod's Point", "Waveny Park", "GHS", "Mianus River Park", "Rockefeller Park"]

list.each { println it }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">each()</code> method is invoked on variable
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">list</code>, looping through each list element.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">each()</code> takes in one argument - a closure object which also
has a single argument.  That single argument represents a list element.  Thanks to some shortened
Groovy syntax, the parenthesis around the closure argument to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
each()</code> are omitted.
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering about the seemingly magical <code class="jarombek-inline-code">it</code> variable
that is never explicitly defined.  If a closure takes in a single parameter, it does not need to be
explicitly declared in the code.  Instead the default <code class="jarombek-inline-code">it</code>
variable is used to access the closure’s argument.  If you want to rewrite this closure with an
explicit argument variable, you could write <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
{ item -> println item }</code>
</p>
<p>
When you see the closure <code class="jarombek-inline-code">{ … }</code> syntax in Groovy code
remember that this only defines the closure.  If you want to run the code inside the closure, it
must be invoked later on.  Think of a closure definition like a method definition - it is a
blueprint of what logic will occur when executed.  Closures are invoked like methods with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">closureName()</code> syntax:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
int number = 1

def timesTen = { number *= 10 }

assert number == 1
timesTen()
assert number == 10
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Look at the assertions before and after the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">timesTen</code>
closure is invoked.  After the closure is defined the value of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
number</code> is still <code class="jarombek-inline-code">1</code> because the code in the closure
hasn't executed yet.  Once the closure is invoked, the value of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">number</code> jumps to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">10
</code> as expected.
</p>
<p>
It may not come as a surprise that closures can manipulate variables in the scope
they are defined (lexical scope).  Closures in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/08-Aug/8-16-groovy-closures/swift/Closures.swift">Swift</a>
and arrow functions in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/
08-Aug/8-16-groovy-closures/javascript/arrow.js">JavaScript</a> can do the same thing.  However,
since Groovy is a JVM language that works closely with Java you may have expected closures to act
similarly to Java lambda functions.
</p>
<p>
Lambda functions can access variables from their lexical scope, but can not manipulate
them.  All variables used inside a lambda that are defined in the functions outer scope must be
effectively final (meaning they can either be explicitly declared final with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">final</code> keyword or be
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-23-2018-javascript-immutable">implicitly immutable</a>).
If this rule is broken Java will not compile.
</p>
<p>
For example this Java code will not compile:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
int listTotal = 0;
list.forEach(item -> {
  listTotal += item;
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In Java I always felt this approach made sense, since lambda functions were introduced to facilitate
functional programming which handles immutable data.  Groovy closures remove this restriction, which
you can argue either gives developers more flexibility or enables development of fragile code.
</p>
<h5>Birthday Context & Delegation</h5>
<Definition word="Birthday Context">
A closures ability to remember the lexical scope in which it was defined, even when it is invoked
in a different scope.  Closures hold a reference to all the items defined in their lexical scope
throughout their lifetime.
</Definition>
<p>
To demonstrate a closures birthday context here is a simple closure that prints out an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">age</code> variable.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
class BirthdayContext {
  def age = 0
  def closure = { println age }
}

def age = 23
def birthObject = new BirthdayContext()

assert birthObject.closure.owner == birthObject
assert birthObject.closure.thisObject == birthObject
assert birthObject.closure.delegate == birthObject

// Prints 0 for age instead of 23
birthObject.closure()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Note that the birthday context of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">closure</code> is the class
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">BirthdayContext</code>.  Since the birthday context is maintained
by the closure throughout its lifetime, the only <code class="jarombek-inline-code">age</code> variable
it is aware of exists in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">BirthdayContext</code>, equaling
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">0</code>.
</p>
<p>
I also accessed three different properties on the closure (remember closures are simply objects).
The first two properties are
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">owner</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">thisObject
</code>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">thisObject</code> is what the closure
currently uses as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> (which may change over the lifetime
of the closure) and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">owner</code> always refers to the direct
enclosing class or closure in which the closure was defined<sup>2,3</sup>.  These two properties
aren't very important to this posts discussion, just note that their values don’t change throughout
the following examples.
</p>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">delegate</code> property is where things get very
interesting.  Groovy allows the programmer to determine how outer scope variables are resolved
inside a closure<sup>4</sup>.  By default closures will resolve variables from the closures lexical scope
(the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">owner</code> property).  However, a user can create an object and
assign it to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">delegate</code> property to change this
behavior<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Changing the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">delegate</code> property will not yet have an
effect on how variables are resolved (the code below will still print
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">0</code>).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
class BirthdayContext {
  def age = 0
  def closure = { println age }
}

def birthObject = new BirthdayContext()

class OtherContext {
  def age = 21
}

def otherObject = new OtherContext()

birthObject.closure.delegate = otherObject

assert birthObject.closure.owner == birthObject
assert birthObject.closure.thisObject == birthObject
assert birthObject.closure.delegate == otherObject

// Will print 0 for age instead of 21
birthObject.closure()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The reason <code class="jarombek-inline-code">age</code> in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
OtherContext</code> was not used is because of the closures delegation strategy.  Delegation
strategies determine how closures resolve variables.  By default the delegation strategy is set to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">OWNER_FIRST</code>, meaning a variable will be searched on the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">owner</code> property before it checks the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">delegate</code> property.  If we change the delegation strategy
to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">DELEGATE_FIRST</code>, invoking the closure will finally print
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">21</code> (not that I really want to relive being 21).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
birthObject.closure.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST

// Will now print 21 instead of 0
birthObject.closure()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Delegation strategies further differentiate Groovy closures from Java lambda functions.  In Java
variables in a lambda function will always access free variables from their lexical scope.
</p>
<Definition word="Free Variable">
A variable that is not local to the current scope<sup>6</sup>.  In the case of a method or
function, a free variable is also not one of the function arguments.  An example of a free
variable would be a classes instance variable accessed from inside a method.
</Definition>
<p>
The <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-11-2017-js-this">closest equivalent</a> to Groovy’s
delegation strategy I can think of is the ability to explicitly define
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">this</code> in a JavaScript function invocation with
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">call()</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">apply()</code>
and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">bind()</code>.
</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>
I am always fascinated to compare features in a language I am learning to those in languages already
in my arsenal.  My look at Groovy closures is not yet complete - in my next post I will look at
using closures in functional programming.

I have learned a lot about Java over the past few months.  I’ve been reading books on it, building projects
with it at work, and even posting on this website about it!  It is obvious by looking at some of my old Java
code just how far I have progressed (especially my SaintsXCTF Android app).  I decided to pull a bunch of
the concepts I’ve learned together and build an API in Java.  This discovery goes through the API and my
design decisions throughout.
</p>
<h5>The API</h5>
<p>
The API I built for this discovery post has two major pieces.  The first is a workout API.  It has an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface along with two concrete classes that implement
it - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code>.  I am
an avid runner and have been experimenting with nordic skiing so I thought they would be appropriate.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The second piece of the API holds a blockchain data structure.  I’ve started to read about blockchain in my
free time so I thought it would be cool to implement a similar data structure in Java.  An important
note - the blockchain data structure I built is extremely primitive.  In fact it is almost unrecognizable
next to the structure used in modern day blockchain technologies.  All my Java code does is implement a chain
of blocks that contain a list of transactions.  That is it.
</p>
<p>
Here is the dependency graph for my blockchain API:
</p>
<figure>
    <img class="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/5-20-18-blockchain.png">
</figure>
<h5>The Workout API</h5>
<p>
The workout API is much simpler so lets start there.  At the top of the API is the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface, which both <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Run</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> implement.  This interface defines the methods
that all exercises must have.  For three of these methods the implementing class must supply the method body.
However one of the methods has a default implementation, which will be used in case the implementing class
doesn't override it.  I made a whole discovery post on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-16-2018-java-default-method">default methods in Java</a> if you want
to learn more.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface Exercise {

    double getMiles();

    Duration getTime();

    LocalDate getDate();

    default Duration pace() {
        long secondsPerMile = getTime().toSeconds() / 60;
        return Duration.ofSeconds(secondsPerMile);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now let’s look at the first implementing class - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code>.  This class
represents a running exercise.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class implements one other
interface besides for <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> called
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code>.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code>
interface has one method called <code class="jarombek-inline-code">compareTo()</code> which is used to compare
two objects of the same type.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Comparable</code> interface gives
objects of a class a natural ordering, which allows them to be sorted in a logical way <sup>1</sup>.  It
also allows them to work properly with sorted collections such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
TreeMap</code> and static methods such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Arrays.sort()</code><sup>2</sup>.
If you ever have a class that has a logical ordering, definitely implement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Comparable</code>!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
import static java.util.Comparator.comparing;

public class Run implements Exercise, Comparable&lt;Run&gt; {

    private static final Comparator&lt;Run&gt; COMPARATOR =
        comparing(Run::getDate)
        .thenComparingDouble(Run::getMiles)
        .thenComparing(Run::getTime)
        .thenComparing(run -> run.surface);

    ...

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Run run) {
        return COMPARATOR.compare(this, run);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With Java 8’s introduction of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Comparator</code> construction methods,
overriding the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">compareTo()</code> method is extremely easy<sup>3</sup>.  The
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">comparing()</code> static method above takes in a lambda function, specifying
the sorting key.  You can then chain on the result from <code class="jarombek-inline-code">comparing()</code>
with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">thenComparing()</code>.  This would be in the case of a tie.  In my
code, the first item that is compared is the date of the run, followed by the miles run, etc.  Note that I use
a method reference instead of a lambda function in this example.
</p>
<Definition word="Method Reference">
A method reference is a shorthand notation for a lambda function (also known as an arrow function).  A common
use case of a lambda is to simply call a method on the lambda input parameter.  Example:
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">(Car car) -> car.getModelYear()</code>.  In Java, for simple lambdas that
just call an existing method you can use a method reference<sup>4</sup>.  The example can be rewritten with a method
reference as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Car::getModelYear()</code>.  Note that we use the type and not the
instance itself in the method reference (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Car</code> not
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">car</code>).  This is because no argument named
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">car</code> is explicitly defined in the Java code to pass to the method
reference.  The only case where you would use an instance in a method reference is when calling a method on an
existing variable outside the lambdas scope<sup>5</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
Another interesting aspect of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class is that it does not have
a public constructor method.  In order to create a new <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> instance
you have to call one of its many static factory methods,
which internally make calls to the private constructor in the class.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// enum representing the surface that the run was on.
public enum Surface {
    GRASS, SAND, ROAD, TRACK, TRAIL, UNKNOWN
}

/* Instance Variables */

private final double miles;
private final Duration time;
private final LocalDate date;
private final Surface surface;

/* Private Constructor */

private Run(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date, Surface surface) {
    this.miles = Objects.requireNonNullElse(miles, 0.0);
    this.time = Objects.requireNonNullElse(time, Duration.ZERO);
    this.date = Objects.requireNonNullElse(date, LocalDate.now());
    this.surface = surface;
}

/* Static Factory Methods */

public static Run create(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date, Surface surface) {
    return new Run(miles, time, date, surface);
}

public static Run create(double miles, Duration time, LocalDate date) {
    return new Run(miles, time, date, Surface.UNKNOWN);
}

public static Run createNow(double miles, Duration time, Surface surface) {
    return new Run(miles, time, LocalDate.now(), surface);
}

public static Run createNow(double miles, Duration time) {
    return new Run(miles, time, LocalDate.now(), Surface.UNKNOWN);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Static factory methods have some benefits and some drawbacks.  You can use them to be more explicit about what type
of object you are creating or even limit the ways in which the constructor can be called.  When I say you can
be more explicit I mean you can uniquely name a static factory method.  Constructors on the other hand are
always the name of the class.  A common problem with static factory methods is that programmers may not even
know they exist!  If they want to find them they will have to search through the JavaDocs, which for large objects
can be quite the hassle.
</p>
<p>
The reason I used static factory methods in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> (and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code>) classes actually has no relation to the reasons I just stated.
When you don't have a public constructor in a class, it is impossible for other classes to extend it
<sup>6</sup>.  Therefore using static factory methods instead of a public constructor stops inheritance!
</p>
<p>
Classes in Java such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> stop inheritance in another way
(by declaring the class as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">final</code>).  But why would you want to stop
inheritance? What is the benefit?
</p>
<p>
One of the requirements for building an immutable object is to prohibit the class to be subclassed.  You may
have created a perfect immutable class with no side effects, but that doesn't mean that a subclass is required
to stay immutable<sup>7</sup>.  This can cause code to behave unexpectedly, since in Java variables are
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-13-2018-generics-arrays-complexities-java">covariant</a>.  Removing
inheritance allows for my <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Ski</code> classes to be safely immutable!
</p>
<p>
The rest of the code in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> class implements the methods defined in
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> interface along with overriding
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">toString()</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">equals()</code>, and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">hashCode()</code> from <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> is written similarly to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code>.
You can check out the code from the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/
2018/05-May/5-20-Java-Generics-API/exercise/Run.java">Run</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/05-May/5-20-Java-Generics-API/

</p>
<h5>The Blockchain API</h5>
<p>
The blockchain API is a bit more complex.  At the top we have the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">BlockChain
</code> interface, which is defined as follows:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface BlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    /**
    * Add an element to the blockchain and return its transaction
    * @param el - the element to be added
    * @return an {@code Optional} value of the transaction added to the blockchain
    */
    Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el);

    /**
    * Find a transaction on the blockchain given its {@code id}
    * @param id - the identifier of a transaction
    * @return an {@code Optional} value of the transaction found on the blockchain
    */
    Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id);

    /**
    * Add a bunch of elements to the blockchain
    * @param elements - a collection of elements to be added to the blockchain.  The parameter
    *                 type is {@code Iterable}, so any class that implements the {@code Iterable}
    *                 interface can be used as an argument.  This includes any class that extends
    *                 {@code Collection}.  The generic type of the {@code Iterable} can be the
    *                 generic type of the blockchain or any subclass.
    */
    void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These are the three key methods that will be used in all blockchain implementations.  A design decision for the
blockchain API was to not have my concrete child classes directly implement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
BlockChain</code>.  Instead I created a skeletal implementation of the interface, and then had my concrete
classes extend the skeletal implementation.
</p>
<Definition word="Skeletal Implementation">
In Java a Skeletal Implementation is when interfaces and abstract classes are combined to create an enhanced
blueprint for subclasses.  Interfaces are powerful in that they do not break encapsulation (unless you use Java 8’s
default methods) while defining the rules for a type.  Abstract classes are powerful because you can make
development quicker and more DRY by defining shared code for subclasses.  A problem with abstract classes is that
    they break encapsulation, making subclasses dependent on the abstract class for implementation details<sup>8</sup>.
Interfaces, even with default methods, cant implement details such as instance variables and overridden methods
from <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.  Skeletal implementations are abstract classes that also
implement the interface.  Now the user has two options - either implement the interface or extend the skeletal
implementation - the second of which could save them time since they would write less code.
</Definition>
<p>
In my case the reason for the skeletal implementation is to reuse the overridden methods from
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.  This pattern works well for the blockchain API because in
many cases checking whether two blockchains are equal does not depend on how the blockchain is implemented
under the hood, just if it holds the same data.  The same can’t be said for the exercise API.  While
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Bike</code> did share
some fields, they also had unique ones for each implementation.  In that case a skeletal implementation would
not have made sense to implement.
</p>
<p>
As a side note, if a blockchain implementation didn’t want to follow the rules enforced in the skeletal
implementation, it could simply implement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">BlockChain</code>.  No problem!
</p>
<p>
Here is my skeletal implementation:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public abstract class AbstractBlockChain&lt;E&gt; implements BlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    // Cache the result of the hashCode() method
    private int hashCode;

    /* Pass along to the child classes */

    @Override
    public abstract Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el);

    @Override
    public abstract Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id);

    @Override
    public abstract void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements);

    abstract List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; getBlockList();

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        var result = hashCode;

        if (result == 0) {
            result = getBlockList().hashCode();
            hashCode = result;
        }

        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == this)
            return true;
        if (!(obj instanceof AbstractBlockChain))
            return false;
        var blockChain = (AbstractBlockChain) obj;
        return Objects.equals(blockChain.getBlockList(), getBlockList());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return getBlockList().toString();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now it is time to look at the meat of the blockchain API - the concrete class <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
SimpleBlockChain</code> and the class <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code>.  The
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> class extends the skeletal implementation, exposing
three methods to interact with the blockchain.  It also holds a list of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Block</code> instances.  This list is our primitive "block chain."  Each block holds a list of transactions which
occurred as well as a reference to the previous block.  An important point is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Block</code> is immutable - if we want to add a new transaction to a block we actually have to create a whole
new block instance.  Remember immutable classes are reliable and easy to test!
</p>
<p>
Here is a diagram of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> classes:
</p>
<figure>
    <img class="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/5-20-18-simpleblock.png">
</figure>
<p>
First lets start with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> class:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public final class SimpleBlockChain&lt;E&gt; extends AbstractBlockChain&lt;E&gt; {

    // A list of the blocks in the blockchain.
    private List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; blockList;

    // Set the max block size for the blockchain.  Once this limit is exceeded a
    // new block will be initialized.
    private int maxBlockSize = 5;

    public SimpleBlockChain() {
        blockList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(new Block&lt;&gt;(null)));
    }

    @Override
    List&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; getBlockList() {
        return blockList;
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You will notice that the number of transactions set per block is five and the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
getBlockList()</code> method is package private, meaning that implementing code cant access it.
</p>
<p>
Now let’s look at the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">add()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
find()</code> methods.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; add(E el) {

    // Get the latest block in the blockList.  This is the block we will add to if it isn't full
    var latestBlock = blockList.get(blockList.size() - 1);

    // Reference to the previous block in the blockchain
    var prevBlock = latestBlock.getPrevBlock();

    // If the block isn't full, create a new block that replicates the old one except with
    // the new transaction.  Replace the existing block with this new one.  Otherwise, create a
    // brand new block and add it to the list.
    if (latestBlock.length() &lt; maxBlockSize) {
        System.out.println("Concat with Existing Block");
        latestBlock = latestBlock.concatTransaction(el, prevBlock);

        blockList.remove(blockList.size() - 1);
        blockList.add(latestBlock);

        return latestBlock.lastTransaction();
    } else {
        System.out.println("Creating a New Block");
        Block&lt;E&gt; block = Block.create(latestBlock);
        block = block.concatTransaction(el, prevBlock);

        blockList.add(block);

        return block.lastTransaction();
    }
}

@Override
public Optional&lt;Block.Transaction&lt;E&gt;&gt; find(long id) {

    // First filter down the blockList to the block that contains the transaction
    Optional&lt;Block&lt;E&gt;&gt; containingBlock = blockList.stream()
        .filter(block -&gt; block.containsTransaction(id)).findFirst();

    // If a block containing the transaction is found, return the transaction.
    // Otherwise return an empty optional.
    if (containingBlock.isPresent()) {
        return containingBlock.get().findTransaction(id);
    } else {
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Both of these methods return an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Optional</code> instance.
I decided to go with this approach so that I wouldn’t have to throw a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
NullPointerException</code> or return <code class="jarombek-inline-code">null</code> if the insert or search
failed.  With optionals it is explicitly clear to the API user that inserting can fail or
a transaction may not exist when searching.  I dedicated an entire discovery post to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-30-2018-java8-optionals">Optionals in Java 8</a> in case you want to learn
more.
</p>
<p>
The last method that needs to be implemented is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code>.  The parameter
type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt;</code> may look a bit unfamiliar.  Let’s break
it down.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
public void addAll(Iterable&lt;? extends E&gt; elements) {
    elements.forEach(this::add);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code> method takes in type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Iterable</code>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> is an interface for an object that can be
looped through.  For example, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Collection</code> interface extends the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> interface.  That means that all classes in the Java collections
framework implement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code>, such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
ArrayList</code> or <code class="jarombek-inline-code">HashSet</code>.  Since the method parameter of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">addAll()</code> is so generic, a lot of flexibility is given to the API user in
regards to argument passing!
</p>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> parameter also has a generic type of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;? extends E&gt;</code>.  This also gives the API even user more flexibility,
since they can pass an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Iterable</code> class with the generic type matching
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> generic type or subtyping the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> generic type.
</p>
<p>
An example would be a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">SimpleBlockChain</code> instance of generic type
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.  When passing an argument to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
addAll()</code> all four of the following are valid:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// Create a new blockchain
BlockChain&lt;Exercise&gt; blockChain = new SimpleBlockChain&lt;&gt;();

/* The following four method calls are all valid */
HashSet&lt;Ski&gt; skis = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(skis);

HashSet&lt;Exercise&gt; exercisesSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(exercisesSet);

List&lt;Run&gt; runs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(runs);

List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercisesList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
blockChain.addAll(exercisesList);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Making the API as flexible as possible is very important and can make end users lives much easier!  Imagine the
hassle of having all your data stored in a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">LinkedList</code> and then finding
out the API only accepts <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> instances!  Make the API users lives
as easy as possible.
</p>
<p>
Time to go over the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> class.  This class doesn’t implement an
interface, but adding one would be a good exercise!  The class also has one package-private constructor and
one private constructor.  Based off this you may think that it is possible to extend this class if you are in
its package.  Although it does have a package-private constructor, the class is declared as
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">final</code>, so subclassing is disallowed.  This is good since
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> is immutable.
</p>
<p>
I am not going to deep dive into the code for the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Block</code> class but you
can look at the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/05-May/
5-20-Java-Generics-API/bchain/Block.java">source code</a> on GitHub.  It even has a nice static member class for
transactions!
</p>
<Definition word="Static Member Class">
In Java a static member class is a static class defined inside a class.  Another option in Java is to have a
non-static member class inside a class.  The big difference is non-static member classes are part
of the outer classes instance - therefore they hold a reference to the contents of the outer class.  Unless
the member class needs access to items in its outer class, it should be defined as static.  This will save both
the time and space required to save a reference of the outer class instance<sup>9</sup>.
</Definition>
<h5>Conclusions</h5>
<p>
I have been working in Java four years now.  While the first two years were just for simple school assignments,
the past two years I have been making production level code in the language.  I am still looking to sharpen my
knowledge on the language all the time.  This API pulled together a lot of concepts that I have been working
on lately, and I hope reading about my journey with the language has been helpful!  As always the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/05-May/5-20-Java-Generics-API">
source code</a> for this discovery is up on GitHub.

Yesterday I began to fix some bugs in my website
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf">saintsxctf.com</a>
and its corresponding native iOS and Android apps (because as we know a
codebase is never complete).  I was looking at the Swift code for my iOS app and found a bug where
I incorrectly selected a substring from a base64 encoded image.  Luckily the fix was easy to implement,
but viewing the code made me remember just how confusing the String structure was in Swift.
</p>
<p>
You would think something as simple as a string would be straightforward, but in Swift there were a
few quirks.  I wrote the code in Xcode 8 and Swift 3 this fall.  Since then Xcode 9 and Swift 4 have
released, making <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> a bit less confusing.  I will dive
into strings in Swift 3 and then look at how the code has changed with Swift 4.
</p>
<h5>Swift 3</h5>
<p>
The first quirk of strings in Swift 3 is obvious when you try to get the length of a string.  There is
no length or count variable on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> structure.  Instead
each <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code>
variable of type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">CharacterView</code>
which is a collection of all the characters in the string<sup>1</sup>.  You can use the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code> object to get the strings size or iterate
over all the characters.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var hello = "hello my name is andy ðŸ˜º"

hello.characters.count // 23

// The characters struct is a collection of Character structs
let chars: String.CharacterView = hello.characters

// You can peform operations on the characters collection just like any other collection
chars.forEach {
    char -> Void in

    print(char)
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
    Like any other collection, you can also perform functions such as filter, map, or sort on
    <code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code>.  Of course array operators are also possible.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
// Filter out all 'a' characters
var filtered = chars.filter {$0 != "a"}

// Remove and return the last character in collection
let catEmoji = filtered.popLast() // 'ðŸ˜º'

// Convert back to a string
String(filtered)

String(filtered[6...7]) // returns 'my'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One of the difficult operations to perform on strings in Swift is getting a substring.  In other languages
its as simple as a <code>substring()</code> function with two integer arguments specifying the start and end
indexes.  Swift also has a <code>substring()</code> function except it accepts a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Range&lt;String.Index&gt;</code> structure.  This struct is constructed with
two <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structures used together with a half-open range operator
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">..&lt;</code><sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that already sounds a bit complicated.  The question you might be asking now is how to we get these
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structures?  We can get them by calling
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">index(String.Index, offsetBy: Int)</code> on our string<sup>3</sup>.
The following code sample gets two <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structs and then
use them to get a substring.  You will notice that since the first parameter
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">index()</code> is a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
String.Index</code> structure we can use the strings built in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
startIndex</code> variable, which is zero.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var runDescription = "I ran 2.12 miles at 6:47 pace on January 3rd, 2018"

let start: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 6)
let end: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 10)

let range: Range&lt;String.Index&gt; = start..&lt;end

runDescription.substring(with: range) // 2.12
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
So why is this <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> madness even necessary?  The
answer has to do with the way Swift characters are stored, and in particular the possible complexities
of using unicode scalars.  Characters in Swift are unicode scalars which are characters defined in
Unicode<sup>4</sup>.  The problem is that some of these scalars are complex and can be combined into one
visible character.  The following code shows two equivalent characters, except one uses two unicode scalars
and the other uses one<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
let e1 = "\u{00EB}" // "eÌˆ"
let e2 = "\u{0065}\u{0308}" // "eÌˆ"

if e1 == e2 {
    print("They are equal!")
}

if e1.characters.count == e2.characters.count {
    print("They both have a length of 1!")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This means that an index in the internal character structure may actually hold only a piece of a
visible character<sup>6</sup>.  Because of this, Swift makes this complexity obvious by implementing
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> struct.  Annoying sure, but it makes sense so
that no newcomers to Swift will be tricked by the character implementation.
</p>
<h5>Swift 4</h5>
<p>
In Swift 4 the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">characters</code> collection is deprecated and the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> struct has become a collection.  This makes
strings easier since you can perform all collection operations directly on the string object.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var hello = "hello my name is andy ðŸ˜º"

print(hello.count) // 23

hello.forEach {
    char -> Void in

    print(char)
}

// In Swift 4 since Strings are collections, we can filter directly on the String
var filtered = String(hello.filter { $0 != "a" })

filtered.removeLast() // 'ðŸ˜º'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
We still have to use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> structure in Swift 4
(unfortunately for those who know the internal structure). However, we can
avoid the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Range</code> structure since our string is a collection!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
var runDescription = "I ran 2.12 miles at 6:47 pace on January 3rd, 2018"

let start: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 6)
let end: String.Index = runDescription.index(runDescription.startIndex, offsetBy: 9)

let miles = runDescription[start...end] // 2.12
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Swift 4 also joins other modern languages (including JavaScripts ES6 standard) by introducing multi-line
strings in code<sup>7</sup>!
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
let stats = """
    name: andy
    date: 2018-01-03
    miles: \(miles)
"""
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although the verbose <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.Index</code> struct is still necessary in
Swift 4, changing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> into a collection and
supporting multi-line strings are major upgrades that make switching to Swift 4 worth it!  The code in this
discovery is up on my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/01-Jan/
1-3-Swift-String">GitHub</a>.

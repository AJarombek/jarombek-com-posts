<p>
Much of my work lately has been in preparation for a personal website that I'm going to build (and
where this blog post will call home!).  The website is going to contain my resume, blog posts, and more.
I am really excited to get started building it!
</p>
<p>
However, the first order of business is to decide which technology stack I want to use for the website.
I've narrowed it down to a full JavaScript stack, from the front-end through the database.  There
are two remaining tech stacks in competition: the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, &amp; Node.js)
and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js &amp; Node.js).  I started my research for building the website
by reading JavaScript books and writing plenty of discovery posts about them.  I also explored Node.js and
MongoDB in depth.  I even made a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-30-2017-nodejs-mongodb-api-prototype">blog post</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/nodejs-mongodb-api-prototype">prototype</a> on both technologies!
Now its time to pick between the two front end JavaScript frameworks: Angular by Google and React.js by Facebook.
</p>
<p>
This blog post is my journey through creating a prototype with Angular.  I'll describe the prototype
at a high level and deep dive into code that makes the website function.  All along the way I will give
my thoughts about Angular and all the other technologies that I learned in the process.  I will conclude
with my current thoughts on Angular and what I feel React.js needs to bring to the table to defeat it!
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of fun (for the most part!) building with Angular, so let's get started!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The Prototype">The Prototype</SectionTitle>
<p>
The MEAN stack prototype is a website that allows its users to upload cat pictures!  Appropriately,
the website is named MeowPics.
</p>

<p>
The MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js technology stack works as follows:
</p>
<figure id="meanstack-image">
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/MEAN-Stack.png">
</figure>
<p>
The first piece of the technology stack for MeowPics that I will go over is the MongoDB document database.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="MongoDB Structure">MongoDB Structure</SectionTitle>
<p>
I've <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">written</a>

 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-27-2017-mongodb-pt4">posts</a> on MongoDB in the past, but in
general terms its a NoSQL document database that stores data in collections of objects.  I used it extensively
in my Node.js and MongoDB prototype as well.  The biggest reason I want to use MongoDB in my website is that
it fits the JavaScript web stack since its queries are in JavaScript and objects are BSON (Binary JSON).
</p>
<p>
The MongoDB database for MeowPics has two main collections for users and cat posts.  There is also an
audit collection that is used for logging purposes when updates, inserts, or deletions are made to documents
in the user or post collections.
</p>
<p>
Here are some insert statements that show the structure of the user and post collections:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
db.user.insertMany([
    {
        username: "andy",
        first: "Andrew",
        last: "Jarombek",
        password: "$2a$10$c/DwED6TayK0d3ce5761zOTBBsnCB.JMpcF4l4Zojqti6Adaym9W2",
        postCount: 4
    },
    {
        username: "tom",
        first: "Thomas",
        last: "Caulfield",
        password: "$2a$10$8Irw8CAvdJr2uBAUYdlinOf8T9dblJiz0mumgNyfiHGBmT9vUweo6",
        postCount: 2
    }
]);

let andy_id = db.user.findOne({username: "andy"})._id;
let tom_id = db.user.findOne({username: "tom"})._id;

db.post.insertMany([
    {
        picture: "russianblue.jpg",
        name: "Cat Pic",
        username: "andy",
        user_id: andy_id,
        first: "Andrew",
        last: "Jarombek",
        date: new Date("2018-02-26"),
        description: "I love this picture!",
        up: 1,
        down: 0
    },
    {
        picture: "toms-cat.jpg",
        name: "Kitty!",
        username: "tom",
        user_id: tom_id,
        first: "Thomas",
        last: "Caulfield",
        date: new Date("2018-02-24"),
        description: "awww!",
        up: 5,
        down: 1
    }
]);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While these statements are performed on the MongoDB database directly, most of my interactions were done
through Mongoose.  Mongoose is a Node.js module that allows you to model objects from MongoDB as well as
perform queries, inserts, updates and more.  It is a really powerful tool that I used in my Node.js
and MongoDB prototype.  For that prototype I was using version 4 of Mongoose.  I was excited to see
that in early January Mongoose 5 was released, including large improvements by using Promises by default and
supporting async functions<sup>1</sup>!  Let's take a look at Mongoose 5 and the rest of the Node.js/Express API.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Nodejs REST API">Node.js REST API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The Node.js/Express API defines three main routes and one for developer testing.  The three main routes
are for users, posts, and authentication.  The users and posts routes define a CRUD API for both
corresponding MongoDB collections.  Here is the entry point code to the server application:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const Post = require('./model/post');
const User = require('./model/user');
const Test = require('./model/test');
const Audit = require('./model/audit');

const userRouter = require('./route/userRouter')(User, Audit);
const postRouter = require('./route/postRouter')(Post, User, Audit);
const authRouter = require('./route/authRouter')(User);
const testRouter = require('./route/testRouter')(Test);

// Mongoose 5.0 uses native JS Promises by default (less config needed!)
mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1/meowcat');

const app = express();

// Set a larger payload limit for HTTP requests since some image data will be large
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true, limit: '50mb'}));
app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '50mb'}));

// Helps protect our API endpoint from well known web security vulnerabilities
app.use(helmet({}));

const port = process.env.port || 3000;

app.use('/api/test', testRouter);
app.use('/api/user', userRouter);
app.use('/api/post', postRouter);
app.use('/api/auth', authRouter);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(JSON.parse('{"title":"Welcome to the Apps API!"}'));
});

module.exports = app.listen(port, () => {
    console.info(`Started MeowCat API on port ${port}`);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you've seen an Express application before this should look familiar, although there are a few unique configurations.
I'm using Mongoose 5, which requires less startup configuration.  I also set the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">limit</code> property for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
bodyParser</code> because the client sends large cat images to the server.  Now any request
with a body under 50MB succeeds.
</p>
<p>
I'm also using the helmet module which secures my API by setting certain HTTP headers on requests
<sup>2</sup>.  All I did to activate helmet was write one line: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
app.use(helmet({}))</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at the user route in the API.  The first thing to look at is the user model
which is defined using Mongoose.  The model defines all the properties of an object and
configures validation rules such as regex matches and length requirements.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: {
        type: String,
        trim: true,
        required: true,
        match: /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/,
        validate: [
            function (username) {
                return username.length <= 15;
            },
            'Username must be less than 15 characters'
        ]
    },
    first: {...},
    last: {...},
    password: {
        type: String,
        trim: true,
        required: true,
        match: /^[^\s]+$/
    },
    postCount: {
        type: Number,
        default: 0
    }
});

UserSchema.index({username: 1});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema, 'user');
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">UserSchema</code> defines five properties -
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">username</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">first</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">last</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">password</code> &amp;
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">postCount</code>.  It also configures validation for each property.  Mongoose even
helps define indexes!  Practically all necessary MongoDB configurations and setup can be done from Mongoose!
Now I am ready to use this model in my <code className="jarombek-inline-code">userRouter</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">userRouter</code> defines a CRUD API for the User model.  Here
is the GET request for all the users in the database.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const userRouter = express.Router();

userRouter.route('/')
    .get((req, res) => {

        find().catch(error => res.status(500).send(error));

        async function find() {
            const users = await User.find().exec();

            res.json(users);
        }
    });
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I am utilizing Mongoose 5's support for async functions here.  It is much more concise and
easy to read this way!  For more on how async functions work you can check out my
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-26-2017-js-async-function">discovery post</a> on the topic.
This code calls the Mongoose <code className="jarombek-inline-code">find()</code> function on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">User</code> schema.  This function asynchronously returns all of the
documents in the user collection.
</p>
<p>
Here is another REST endpoint defined on the user route - this time for HTTP DELETE requests.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
userRouter.route('/:username')
    .delete(jwtUtils.checkIfAuthenticated, (req, res) => {

        remove().catch(error => res.status(500).send(error));

        async function remove() {
            await req.user.remove();

            // Should return null if it was successfully deleted
            const deleted = await User.findOne({username: req.user.username}).exec();

            // Call the catch() function if the user was not deleted
            if (deleted !== null) {
                throw Error('User Still Exists');
            }

            // Audit the deletion of a user
            const audit = new Audit({
                object: req.user._id,
                type: 'user',
                message: `Deleted User ${req.user.username}`,
                source: 'NodeJS MeowCat API'
            });

            await Audit.create(audit);

            res.status(204).send();
        }
    });
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In this code I used three Mongoose functions: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">remove()</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">findOne()</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">create()</code>.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">remove()</code> deletes an instance of
the Mongoose user schema and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findOne()</code> tries to find that user
to make sure it was properly deleted.  Finally I use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">create()</code>
to insert a new document in the audit collection.  This audit collection holds all the important
database interaction history.  Let's take a quick look at the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">AuditSchema</code> because it is quite unique:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const AuditSchema = new Schema({
    time: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now(),
        expires: 604800 // Expires after a week
    },
    object: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    type: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        enum: ['user', 'post']
    },
    message: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    source: String
}, { capped: { size: 8192, max: 100, autoIndexId: true }});

AuditSchema.index({time: 1});
AuditSchema.index({object: 1});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Audit', AuditSchema, 'audit');
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are two important aspects of this schema.  The first is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
expires</code> property on <code className="jarombek-inline-code">time</code> and the corresponding
index defined for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">time</code>.  This is how you create
a time-to-live (TTL) collection in Mongoose.  In MongoDB a TTL collection is one that expires its
documents after a set amount of time<sup>3</sup>.  In this case the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
audit</code> collection expires its documents after a week.  This is a similar behavior to many
logging frameworks in applications.
</p>
<p>
The second important aspect is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">capped</code> property at the end
of the schema definition.  This defines a max number of documents (the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">max</code> property)
and a max number of bytes (the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">size</code> property) that are allowed in the
collection<sup>4</sup>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">audit</code> collection allows
a maximum of 100 documents of no greater than 8192 bytes.
</p>
<p>
Creating complex MongoDB structures in Mongoose shows off the versatility of the module.
I use Mongoose with all my user and post routes.  One important
aspect of the post route is the ability to upload a picture with a cat post.  I need to store this
picture as a file on the server Node.js is running on.  Let's first look at the HTTP POST endpoint
for posts, where I instruct Node to save the picture data as a file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const express = require('express');
const files = require('../utils/files');
const jwtUtils = require('../utils/jwt');

const postRouter = express.Router();

postRouter.route('/')
    .post(jwtUtils.checkIfAuthenticated, (req, res) => {

        // pictureData isn't part of the Post Schema, so remove it once we assign it a variable
        const data = req.body.pictureData;
        delete req.body.pictureData;

        const post = new Post(req.body);

        if (post.picture &amp;&amp; post.name &amp;&amp; post.picture &amp;&amp; data) {

            // The naming convention for saved files is [username]_[filename].[filetype]
            post.picture = `${post.username}_${post.picture}`;

            // First save the file to the servers filesystem
            files.saveFile(post.picture, data);

            // Then insert the post into MongoDB
            insert().catch(error => res.status(500).send(error));

            async function insert() {...}
        }
    });
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This endpoint extracts picture data from the HTTP request body and sends it to the function
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">saveFile()</code>. The arguments for this function pass base 64
encoded picture data and the file name.  Let's take a look at <code className="jarombek-inline-code">saveFile()</code> now:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

exports.saveFile = function saveFile(name, data) {

    // Replace the start of the base 64 encoding - this is not the actual picture file data
    const base64 = data.replace(/^data:image\/([a-z]+);base64,/, "");

    fs.writeFile(path.join(__dirname, `../pics/${name}`), base64, 'base64', (err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The imported <code className="jarombek-inline-code">fs</code> module allows for interaction with the
filesystem.  I use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">writeFile()</code> function to
create a new file in the filesystem with the base 64 encoded picture data.
</p>
<p>
Besides for adding a new file when uploading a post, I also delete a file when no more posts reference
it.  You can check out all of the file manipulation functions I created in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype/blob/master/src/utils/files.js">files.js</a>
and all the endpoints that use these functions in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype/blob/master/src/route/postRouter.js">
postRouter.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
You may have noticed that I passed <code className="jarombek-inline-code">postRouter.post()</code>
the argument <code className="jarombek-inline-code">jwtUtils.checkIfAuthenticated</code>.  This is a function
used for authentication.  Certain endpoints in my REST API
require the user to be authenticated, such as deleting a user or creating a new post.  When a user
logs in, they go through the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">authRouter</code> and get an
authentication token.  This token is included on all further HTTP requests.  I used
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication in my application.  JWT's are a huge topic,
and I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions/blob/master/Discoveries/
2018/03-Mar/3-11-JWT/View/jwt.html">article</a> about some of
the basic concepts.  Check it out if you want more details!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Webpack Not In the Web">Webpack Not In the Web?</SectionTitle>
<p>
The MEAN Stack prototype was also my first experience with Webpack!  While Angular CLI is built
on top of Webpack, you don't have to interact with the underlying Webpack config files to use it.  The
Node.js server was my first actual time configuring Webpack to bundle an application!
</p>
<p>
Webpack is a module bundler commonly used in JavaScript projects, especially those used in the
browser<sup>5</sup>.  It builds a dependency graph of a projects modules and bundles those modules
into a few larger files.  The reason for bundling JavaScript files is
that HTTP requests from the web browser to the server are expensive.  If JavaScript
files are bundled into a smaller number of files, the amount of HTTP requests is reduced, thus speeding up the
web application.  Webpack is quite complex and deserves many discovery posts of its own, but that is the basic idea!
</p>
<p>
While Webpack is mostly used in the front-end, there is nothing stopping you from using it with Node.js.  The
environment Webpack runs on is changed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">target</code> field
in the Webpack configuration<sup>6</sup>.  Let's take a look at the Webpack configuration file
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype/blob/master/src/webpack.config.js">
webpack.config.js</a> used in my Node.js/Express server:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
module.exports = {
    entry: [
        'babel-polyfill',
        './src/app'
    ],
    target: "node",
    node: {
        __dirname: false,
        __filename: false
    },
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.js?$/,
            use: "babel-loader",
            exclude: /node_modules/
        }]
    },
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, '../build'),
        filename: "app.js"
    }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
First this configuration declares two entry points for
Webpack to start building its dependency graph.  The entry <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
babel-polyfill</code> is necessary to use those wonderful async functions seen in my routes.
I then set the target environment to node.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">node</code>
field is necessary because of a bug where the variable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
__dirname</code> contains the incorrect value after being bundled with Webpack<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">module</code> field defines Webpack loaders.  Loaders
perform transformations on files during the bundling process.
The loader used here is for Babel, a compiler that transpiles ES6+ JavaScript code into ES5.
While less important on the server side since newest versions of Node.js support the newest
JavaScript features, transpiling into ES5 gives much greater browser
compatibility for a web application.  I did a full discovery on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-10-2017-es6-modules-babel">Babel</a> as well!
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the Webpack config for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">babel-loader</code>.  The
regex defined in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code> property tells Webpack to
only use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">babel-loader</code> on files with the JavaScript
extension.  The other regex defined in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exclude</code>
tells Webpack to not run this loader on the projects module dependencies in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">node_modules</code> folder.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">output</code> property defines where the
completed bundle is located.  I tell Webpack to put it in the build directory with the name app.js.
And just like that, the Webpack config for the server application is completed!
</p>
<p>
I defined an npm script to start Webpack with this configuration in the projects
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
...
"scripts": {
    "start:dev": "webpack-node-dev --config src/webpack.config.js"
},
...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While the server side app doesn't really require bundling, it was a really good experience to start
using Webpack.  Also configuration on the server is much simpler than on the
front-end, so it was great for a beginner.  I am excited to use Webpack with my upcoming React prototype!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Unit Tests and CI">Unit Tests and CI</SectionTitle>
<p>
The MEAN Stack prototype was the first project I made with Continuous Integration (CI).  CI
integrates code into the main repository on every commit.  With this approach unit tests
are run every time new code is submitted.  This allows for constant regression testing and makes it
easier to catch bugs early on.  I wrote a whole discovery about using <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-9-2018-travisci">TravisCI</a> for
CI in this project!  It's a game changer, and I will use it in my projects from now on!
</p>
<p>
With CI its important to have good unit tests.  I have a bad habit of slacking on writing
test code.  While I didn't completely break this bad habit with the MEAN prototype, I did write
some test code for my REST endpoints!
</p>
<p>
I used the supertest npm module for testing HTTP requests along with the mocha test framework.
Supertest is a really nice API that made testing my endpoints easy!  Here is the testing suite for my main app endpoint:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../src/app');

// Tests for the default endpoint '/'
describe("GET '/'", () => {
    it('responded with a 200', () => {
        return request(app).get('/').expect(200);
    });

    it("returned correct JSON", () => {
        return request(app)
            .get('/')
            .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
            .expect(200)
            .expect('Content-Length', '36');
    });

    it("Uses Helmet", () => {
        return request(app)
            .get('/files')
            .expect('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff')
            .expect('X-DNS-Prefetch-Control', 'off')
            .expect('X-Download-Options', 'noopen')
            .expect('X-Frame-Options', 'SAMEORIGIN')
            .expect('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block')

<p>
In the mocha testing framework <code className="jarombek-inline-code">describe()</code> defines a testing
group and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">it()</code> defines a test
case<sup>8</sup>.  In the code above I defined a testing group with three test cases.
The first test case checks to see if an endpoint returns an HTTP 200 OK status.  I use the
supertest <code className="jarombek-inline-code">get()</code> function to make a GET request to an endpoint
and use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">expect()</code> to define the anticipated HTTP response.
</p>
<p>
The second and third test cases also use these basic building blocks.  I chain
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">expect()</code> functions to
define multiple anticipated responses.  The second test checks that the returned
content type is JSON and is a certain length.  The last test case makes sure the helmet
module discussed earlier is properly adding HTTP headers.
It is really easy to create HTTP endpoint tests with supertest and mocha!
</p>
<p>
I defined one more test suite in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype/blob/master/test/postRouter.test.js">
postRouter.test.js</a>.  One of the test cases makes sure an
endpoint requiring JWT authentication returns a 401 error when no token is present on the request header.
</p>
<p>
That finishes up my discussion of the Node.js/Express backend for my MEAN stack prototype.
If you want to check out all the code for the Node.js backend its available on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype">GitHub</a>.  Now let's move on to the Angular frontend!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The Angular Front-End">The Angular Front-End</SectionTitle>
<p>
The frontend of the MEAN stack uses Angular.  Angular is a full fledged frontend framework, meaning
the code structure defined by Angular must be followed.  While this gives less flexibility
to the developer, it makes sure the code stays structured even in the most complex
applications.  The latest version of Angular at the time of this writing is 5,
and that is what I used in my prototype.  While you can write Angular applications in JavaScript or
any language that transpiles to JavaScript, the team at Angular suggests that you use TypeScript.
TypeScript is a language developed by Microsoft that applies static typing on top of JavaScript.  I wrote a discovery post on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-8-2018-typescript">TypeScript</a> that explores different details of
the language and analyzes what I learned about it from this project.
</p>
<p>
I also wrote a discovery post about my
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions">first impressions</a>
of the Angular framework.  In that post I was a bit critical of
Angular.  While I think Angular is far from perfect, it was a joy to learn and work
with.  It does have its issues which I will cover in this blog.  Another note is that this blog
isn't going to teach beginners how to use Angular.  I expect that
you have some knowledge about the framework and how it works.  I will go through all the major
components of my application as well as other cool services, directives, etc.  Let's get started by
exploring the app component.  This component is the entry point for
the application and holds all the routes in the single page application (SPA).
</p>
<SectionTitle title="App Component">App Component</SectionTitle>
<p>
Before looking at the app component directly, its important to observe the code in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/app.module.ts">
app.module.ts</a>.  This module contains all the components except for user profiles and cat posts.
It also defines the routes for the application:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
export const routes: Routes = [
    {path: '', component: HomeComponent},
    {path: 'user', loadChildren: './profile/profile.module#ProfileModule'},
    {path: 'about', component: AboutComponent},
    {path: 'login', component: LoginComponent},
    {path: 'signup', component: SignupComponent},
    {path: '**', redirectTo: ''}
];
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The user route is unique because it implements lazy loading.  The module
for the user route is not loaded from the server until the route is traversed.  I discussed
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-27-2018-angular-5-routing">Angular lazy loading</a>
in a discovery post.
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering why the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AppComponent</code> is missing in
these routes.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AppComponent</code> is actually the root component
and is bootstrapped into the module<sup>9</sup>.  Its defined in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">bootstrap</code> property on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@NgModule</code> definition.  On app launch the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">AppComponent</code> is bootstrapped and rendered by default.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
@NgModule({
    ...
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AppComponent</code> template defines the navigation bar for
the website.  Clicking on the navigation bar changes the route.  Based on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">routes</code>
variable shown before, different routes display different components on the page.  The
components are displayed in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> element, as
discussed further in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-27-2018-angular-5-routing">discovery post</a>.
The code for the app component template is found in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/app.component.html">app.component.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The navigation bar uses Bootstrap and Sass for styling.  In fact, the entire website UI uses a
combination of Bootstrap and Sass.  I really loved Sass and how it modularized
my stylesheets, making them easier to read and work with.  I made a discovery post about
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass">Sass</a> if you want to learn more.  On the other hand,
I have mixed feelings about Bootstrap.  While it does have cool components like the navbar I used for this
website, it also comes with many frustrations.  For one the current state of Bootstrap is a bit of a mess.
Different versions come with completely different naming conventions.  To make matters worse the documentation
online is not up to date with the current release.  This made developing with Bootstrap really frustrating.
</p>
<p>
If that was the only issue with Bootstrap I'd suggest to wait for its version to stabilize
before jumping on board.  However, I also found that many Bootstrap components were not very
customizable.  Bootstrap seem like more of a prototyping/pet project tool than something worth using in
production.  I'll demonstrate the lack of customization later.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/
app.component.ts">app.component.ts</a> code also subscribes to certain services that emit and
receive messages to and from child components.  This allows for message passing between components.
I'll go into detail about these services once I look at the child components that subscribe to them.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the default route of the application which displays the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">HomeComponent</code>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Home Page">Home Page</SectionTitle>
<figure id="maincomponent-image">
    <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/main-component.png">
</figure>
<p>
The code in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">HomeComponent</code> is pretty simple.  It subscribes to
a service called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">postService</code>.  By calling
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getAll()</code> function in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
postService</code> the component gets all the cat posts stored on the server.  These are displayed in the UI.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import {PostService} from "../post.service";
import {Post} from "../models/post";
import {environment} from "../../environments/environment";

@Component({
    selector: 'app-home',
    templateUrl: './home.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss']
})
export class HomeComponent {
    posts: [Post];

    // The private modifier creates a new instance variable
    constructor(private postService: PostService) {

        // When the Observable getAll() value returns give it to the posts variable
        postService.getAll().subscribe(data => {

            this.posts = data;

            // Different behavior depending on environment
            if (environment.evt === 'dev') {
                this.posts.forEach(post => {
                    post.date = new Date(post.date);
                    post.picture = `${post.picture}`;
                });
            }
        });
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">postService</code> is one of the many services I created
for this project.  It makes HTTP requests to the posts API.  Here is a look at the service:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {Post} from "./models/post";
import {HttpClient} from "@angular/common/http";
import {Observable} from "rxjs/Observable";
import {HttpService} from "./http.service";

@Injectable()
export class PostService implements HttpService {

    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

    getAll(): Observable<[any]> {
        return this.http.get<[Post]>(`/api/post`);
    }

    get(id: number): Observable&lt;any&gt; {
        return this.http.get&lt;Post&gt;(`/api/post/${id}`);
    }

    post(post: Post): Observable&lt;any&gt; {
        return this.http.post&lt;Post&gt;(`/api/post`, post);
    }

    put(post: Post): Observable&lt;any&gt; {
        return this.http.put&lt;Post&gt;(`/api/post/${post.id}`, post);
    }

    delete(id: number): Observable&lt;any&gt; {
        return this.http.delete&lt;any&gt;(`/api/post/${id}`);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Each function corresponds with a route defined in the Node.js <code className="jarombek-inline-code">postRouter</code>
API.  The service implements a TypeScript interface.  The code for this interface is found in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/http.service.ts">
http.service.ts</a>.  This interface is implemented in all my HTTP request services.
</p>
<p>
The HTML template for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">HomeComponent</code> loops through
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">posts</code> array and passes each post to the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CatPictureComponent</code>.  This component displays the
cat post on the UI.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;div id="home-container" class="container-fluid mt-3"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Go through all the cat posts and pass each post to the cat-picture component --&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-columns"&gt;
        &lt;div *ngFor="let post of posts"&gt;
            &lt;cat-picture [post]="post"&gt;&lt;/cat-picture&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Cat Posts">Cat Posts</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CatPictureComponent</code> displays details about a cat post and a
picture in the UI.  It does this with the Bootstrap card component<sup>10</sup>.  The card component
makes displaying cat posts in a resizable grid extremely easy.  The one problem I
have is the card components default behavior can't be customized.  By default the cards component
displays each post from left to right.  This is a problem since old cat posts now show up at
the top of the page.  Ideally I could change this behavior to populate cards from
top to bottom instead.  However, Bootstrap does not allow for this customization.
Bootstrap components aren't quite adequate for the needs of a production level website.
</p>
<p>
Here is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CatPictureComponent</code> template.  Take a close look
at the first <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;p&gt;</code> element, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">(click)</code> event, and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
[routerLink]</code> property.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;div class="card"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-fluid cat-image" src={{post?.picture}} alt={{post?.picture}}&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-block mx-2"&gt;
        &lt;h4 class="card-title mt-2"&gt;{{post?.name}}&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;
            &lt;small class="text-muted" (click)="emitUsername()"
                    [routerLink]="['../../user/profile', post?.username || '']"&gt;
                {{post?.first + " " + post?.last}}
            &lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text cat-post-date"&gt;
            &lt;small class="text-muted"&gt;
                {{post?.date.toDateString()}}
            &lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text cat-post-description"&gt;{{post?.description}}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The click event and router are placed on the name of the user who made the post.  This allows users
to click the name and view the uploader's profile.  Besides for changing the SPA route, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">emitUsername()</code> function is also called.  This function
creates a message containing the posts username.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ProfileComponent</code> will subscribe to this emitted message so it knows
which users information needs to be loaded.  The code for emitting the message is found in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/cat-picture/
cat-picture.component.ts">cat-picture.component.ts</a>
and the subscriber of the message is found in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/profile/
profile.component.ts">profile.component.ts</a>.
</p>
<p>
While I don't mind setting up messaging between components, I wish there was a nicer way to store
global data for use throughout the application.  This seems to be a weak point
of the Angular framework, and I am curious how React.js handles the same situation.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Login Page">Login Page</SectionTitle>
<figure id="logincomponent-image">
    <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/login-component.png">
</figure>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LoginComponent</code> is pretty self
explanatory - it logs in a user!  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LoginComponent</code> asks for authentication
from the server and get a JWT in response.  I then store the JWT in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
localStorage</code> and send it along with all HTTP requests
to the server.  For more information on that process you can check out my discovery post on JWT.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LoginComponent</code> also uses the Angular forms API to easily
create and validate form inputs.  I really liked working with the forms API.  It simplified
what is often the most convoluted part of a web application.  I remember how difficult it was to
create a simple login and signup form on my first website (which was a LAMP stack website using JQuery
in the frontend).  The Angular approach to forms is a welcome change!
</p>
<p>
You can check out the code for the login form in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/login/
login.component.ts">login.component.ts</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/login/
login.component.html">login.component.html</a>.
A more complex example of the form API is found in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/signup/
signup.component.ts">signup.component.ts</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/master/web-app/src/app/signup/
signup.component.html">signup.component.html</a>.
</p>
<figure id="signupcomponent-image">
    <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/signup-component.png">
</figure>
<p>
Another cool thing about the forms API is the ease of implementing a custom validator.
Validators are placed on any form element.  You can check out a custom validator I
made which checks for whitespace in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/
master/web-app/src/app/shared/no-whitespace.validator.ts">no-whitespace.validator.ts</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Post Page">Post Page</SectionTitle>
<p>
The post page is the most complex page in the website.  The component guides the user through a
multi-part process of uploading a new cat post.  It involves the Angular forms API, picture file
uploading, and calls to the Node.js posts API.
</p>
<p>
The component lives in three different states.  Each of these states presents a different UI for
the user.  The first state allows users to upload cat post details in an Angular form.  The
second state allows them to upload a cat picture.  The third state occurs after the upload
is successfully made.
</p>
<p>
In order to display these three states, I used Angular's <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
&lt;ng-template&gt;</code> HTML element.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;ng-template&gt;</code> is Angular's implementation
of HTML's native <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;template&gt;</code> element.  Anything in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;template&gt;</code> is not be rendered when the page first loads, but is added
to the page later on.  In my case the contents of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
&lt;ng-template&gt;</code> are rendered when certain variables in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PostComponent</code>
are set to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>.
</p>
<p>
One of the challenges I faced with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PostComponent</code> was
retrieving the value in an HTML <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;input&gt;</code>
element before it was removed from the DOM.  This scenario occurred when the first state was destroyed and the second state
was created.  The solution was to create a spy directive on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;input&gt;</code> elements<sup>11</sup>.  The spy monitored
the lifecycle of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;input&gt;</code> element.  When the element was
created or destroyed I performed certain actions, such as initializing
its value or retrieving its value.  Here is a look at the spy directive:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import {Directive, ElementRef, OnDestroy, OnInit, Renderer2} from '@angular/core';
import {LifecycleService} from "./lifecycle.service";
import {Lifecycle} from "../models/lifecycle";

@Directive({
    selector: '[spy]'
})
export class SpyDirective implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

    constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private el: ElementRef,
                private lifecycleService: LifecycleService) {}

    /**
     * The initialization lifecycle for the spied upon element.  Send an appropriate
     * notification to the lifecycle service for subscribers to consume.
     */
    ngOnInit(): void {
        const status: Lifecycle = this.lifecycleObject("init");

        this.lifecycleService.emitData(status);
    }

    /**
     * The destroy lifecycle for the spied upon element.  Send an appropriate
     * notification to the lifecycle service for subscribers to consume.
     */
    ngOnDestroy(): void {
        const status: Lifecycle = this.lifecycleObject("destroy");

        this.lifecycleService.emitData(status);
    }

    lifecycleObject(event: string) : Lifecycle {
        return {
            id: this.el.nativeElement.id,
            event: event,
            value: this.el.nativeElement.value
        };
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lifecycleService</code> allows for message passing between
the spy directive and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PostComponent</code>.
You can look at this service in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype/blob/
master/web-app/src/app/shared/lifecycle.service.ts">lifecycle.service.ts</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once again I think the message passing services are a messy approach for sharing data
between components.  Maybe there is a better approach out there.  However, the fact you can
monitor the lifecycle of any HTML element through a directive is really cool!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Unit Testing Angular">Unit Testing Angular</SectionTitle>
<p>
I didn't do much unit testing with my Angular application.  However it is set up with TravisCI
and a testing suite just like the server side Node.js code.  I did write unit tests for a few mock services
in the project.  These mock services allowed me to work on the front-end code before the Node.js API
was created.  Mock services were very helpful during early development!
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of unit tests for one of my mock services:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { TestBed, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';
import {MockUserService} from "./mock-user.service";
import {User} from "../models/user";

describe('MockUserService', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        TestBed.configureTestingModule({
            providers: [MockUserService]
        });
    });

    it('service should be created', inject([MockUserService], (service: MockUserService) => {
        expect(service).toBeTruthy();
    }));

    it("getAll() should get two users", inject([MockUserService],
                                        (service: MockUserService) => {
        service.getAll().subscribe(users => {
            expect(users.length).toBe(2);
        });
    }));

    it("get() should get user 'andy'", inject([MockUserService],
                                        (service: MockUserService) => {
        service.get("andy").subscribe(user => {
            expect(user.username).toBe('andy');
            expect(user.first).toBe('Andrew');
            expect(user.last).toBe('Jarombek');
        });
    }));

    it("post() should return new user", inject([MockUserService],
                                        (service: MockUserService) => {
        service.post(new User("joe", "Joe", "Smith")).subscribe(user => {
            expect(user.username).toBe('joe');
            expect(user.first).toBe('Joe');
            expect(user.last).toBe('Smith');
        });
    }));

    ...
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When Angular CLI sets up components and services, it also generates a spec file that contains
unit testing code for the component or service.  It only contains one test by default.  This test makes
sure that the component or service loads properly.  Although I wasn't adding any more tests to the spec
files, I found it really helpful to maintain the default test for each
component.  This helped ensure all my components followed the coding conventions of the
Angular framework.  It even helped me to make design decisions.  For example, when the test code for
a component became really difficult or impossible to maintain, I'd create
a new module to hold the component.  This is exactly what happened when I
separated out the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CatPictureComponent</code> into its own module.
</p>
<p>
However, in general writing unit tests for Angular was a big pain.  On many occasions the
unit testing code for a component would fail without any obvious reason.  Also there is no official documentation,
so you have to hope someone else ran into the same issue and asked about it online.  This was not always the case.
An easy to use testing suite could give React.js a leg up on Angular.

That concludes the discussion on my MEAN Stack prototype.  If you want to check out the frontend code
it is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
As far as further steps are concerned, I might continue updating this prototype as Angular versions
advance.  That would be a nice
way to keep informed about the framework and always have a working prototype to look back on.
</p>
<p>
I may also deploy it to AWS or another cloud service.  Then I could get
experience pushing an Angular app all the way to production!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
While I liked the Angular framework, it did have some shortcomings.  Weak points include less than ideal
cross component data transfer and complex unit testing.  These shortcomings give React some
room to beat Angular when I pick the front end JavaScript framework/library for
my website.  Angular also does a lot of things well.  I really enjoyed the forms API and the strict
framework simplifies frontend development.  TypeScript also really grew on me!  I'm
excited to work with Angular again in the future and look forward to learning React!

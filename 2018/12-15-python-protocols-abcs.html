Python provides many different techniques for declaring interfaces.  Some are informal such as
protocols, while some are strict such as ABCs.  The lack of an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
interface</code> keyword makes learning all the different techniques a bit more difficult.  This
discovery post explores different options for creating interfaces in Python.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Protocols & Duck Typing">Protocols & Duck Typing</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Protocol">
In Python a protocol is an informal interface known as an accepted truth or defined only in
documentation and not strictly in code<sup>1</sup>.  For example, any class that implements the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">__container__()</code> special method is said to follow the "container
protocol."  While this is an accepted truth, there is no syntax in the Python language that declares
a class as following the container protocol.  Python classes can implement multiple protocols.
</Definition>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#duck-typing">Duck typing</a> is
used to determine if a class follows a protocol.  Duck typing is when you assume an object follows a
certain protocol based on the existence of certain methods or properties.

<p>
In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-14-2018-python-class-features">previous discovery</a> I
mentioned how Python 3.5 added type hints to help enforce types in IDEs.  Type hints can also exist
in separate files with the <strong>.pyi</strong> extension.  I created one of these files for the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">TrailMap</code> class.  Its named <strong>TrailMap.pyi</strong>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
class TrailMap:

  # TrailMap constructor
  def __init__(self, trails: list(tuple)) -> None:
  self.__trails = trails

  # Property getter method
  def trails(self) -> tuple: ...

  # Python special methods which implement the Sequence protocol
  def __len__(self) -> int: ...
  def __getitem__(self, item) -> TrailMap: ...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Take note that none of these methods contain bodies.  They simply declare the type hints for the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">TrailMap</code> class in <strong>TrailMap.py</strong>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ABCs">ABCs</SectionTitle>
<p>
Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) are formal interfaces in Python.  ABCs can contain both abstract and
concrete methods.  In general its recommended to inherit from an ABC instead of a concrete class<sup>2</sup>.
ABCs in Python are comparable to abstract classes in Java, although Python ABCs support multiple
inheritance while Java abstract classes do not.
</p>
<p>
It’s recommended to only subclass ABCs defined in the Python standard library<sup>3</sup>.  Using
the existing Python ABCs follows the practice of using existing language features instead of creating
your own.  For example, to find the length of an object you should simply invoke the built-in
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">len()</code> function instead of a custom implementation.
</p>
<p>
With this recommendation out of the way, I did create a custom ABC just to demonstrate how it works.
My custom class <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> only needs to subclass
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">abc.ABC</code> in order to become an ABC.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import abc


class Exercise(abc.ABC):
  ...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Inside an ABC, abstract methods are declared with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
@abc.abstractmethod</code> decorator.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> ABC
declares three abstract methods, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">miles()</code> for the miles
exercised, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">time</code> for the length of the exercise, and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">date</code> for when the exercise occurs.  Abstract method bodies
are implemented in classes that extend the ABC.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
@property
@abc.abstractmethod
def miles(self) -> numbers.Real:
  """
  Get the distance of the exercise in miles
  """

@property
@abc.abstractmethod
def time(self) -> tuple:
  """
  Get the length of the exercise in minutes and seconds
  """

@property
@abc.abstractmethod
def date(self) -> date:
  """
  Get the date that the exercise occurred
  """
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> also contains one concrete method which calculates
the mile pace of the exercise.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def pace(self) -> tuple:
  """
  Calculate the pace of the exercise in minutes and seconds
  """
  minutes, seconds = self.time
  total_seconds = (minutes * 60) + seconds
  seconds_per_mile = total_seconds / self.miles
  return seconds_per_mile / 60, seconds_per_mile % 60
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I ran some assertion statements to confirm that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> is
a subclass of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">abc.ABC</code> and that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
abc.ABC</code> is the second class in the method resolution order of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
assert Exercise.__mro__ == (Exercise, abc.ABC, object)
assert issubclass(Exercise, abc.ABC)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Subclassing an ABC is easy.  All you have to do is extend the ABC and implement all the abstract methods.
The following <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> concrete class extends the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> ABC.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import numbers
from datetime import date
from Exercise import Exercise


class Run(Exercise):

  def __init__(self, miles: numbers.Real, time: tuple, run_date: date, surface: str) -> None:
    """
    Initialize a new Run object, which directly subclasses the Exercise ABC
    :param miles: the number of miles run
    :param time: the time taken to complete the run.  Should be of the form (minutes, seconds)
    :param run_date: the day that the run took place
    """
    self.__miles = miles
    self.__time = time
    self.__date = run_date
    self.__surface = surface

  def miles(self) -> numbers.Real:
    return self.__miles

  @property
  def time(self) -> tuple:

  def date(self) -> date:
    return self.__date

  @property
  def surface(self) -> str:
    """
    Get the surface that the run occurred on
    :return: a string describing the running surface
    """
    return self.__surface

  def __str__(self) -> str:
    """
    Create a string representation of the run
    :return: a string
    """
    return '(Ran {} miles in {}:{} on {} on {})'.format(self.miles, self.time[0], self.time[1],
                                                        self.date, self.surface)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When looking at the metadata of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> the class is a subclass
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> and object instances are also instances of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
assert Run.__mro__ == (Run, Exercise, abc.ABC, object)

run = Run(1.14, (10, 12), date(2018, 11, 27), 'Sand')
assert str(run) == '(Ran 1.14 miles in 10:12 on 2018-11-27 on Sand)'

assert isinstance(run, Exercise)
assert issubclass(Run, Exercise)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Directly subclassing an ABC like I did with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Run</code> is only
one of the subclassing options that Python offers.  Python also allows for classes to be registered
as virtual subclasses of an ABC<sup>4</sup>.  Virtual subclasses don’t need to implement the methods
of the parent class.  Instead, Python will trust that the subclass maintains an is-a relationship
with the parent class.  The following <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Elliptical</code> class is
a virtual subclass of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
@Exercise.register
class Elliptical:

  def __init__(self, time: tuple) -> None:
    self.__time = time

  @property
  def time(self):
    return self.__time
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Virtual subclasses are registered with the ABCs <code class="jarombek-inline-code">register()</code>
class method.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">register()</code> is commonly used as a decorator
on the subclass.  The above example used the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@Exercise.register</code>
annotation on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Elliptical</code> class.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Elliptical</code> does not implement the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">date()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">miles()</code>
abstract methods in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> ABC.  Despite this discrepancy,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Elliptical</code> is still a subclass of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code> and instances of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Elliptical</code> are still instances
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
elliptical = Elliptical((60, 0))

assert isinstance(elliptical, Exercise)
assert issubclass(Elliptical, Exercise)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Virtual subclasses give ABCs more flexibility.  This flexibility even further differentiates the strict
abstract classes of Java from ABCs in Python.
</p>
<p>
While more flexible than abstract classes in Java, ABCs in Python are still much stricter than protocols
which utilize duck typing.  However, Python does also allow for ABCs to use duck typing when determining
subclasses.  ABCs implement duck typing with the special method <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
__subclasshook__()</code>.  This method helps a class determine if another class is a subclass.  Behind
the scenes <code class="jarombek-inline-code">__subclasshook__()</code> is invoked when
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">isinstance()</code> is invoked with an object or
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">issubclass</code> is invoked with a class.
</p>
<p>
I added <code class="jarombek-inline-code">__subclasshook__()</code> to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code> ABC.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">__subclasshook__()</code> in
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> declares that if a method <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
is_exercise()</code> is found anywhere in a class or its parent hierarchy, it’s considered a subclass
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
@classmethod
def __subclasshook__(cls, c):
  """
  Help determine if a class is a subclass.  Use duck typing to make any class with an
  'is_exercise' method a subclass of Exercise
  :param c: The class to check if it is a subclass
  :return: True if the class is a subclass of Exercise, otherwise NotImplemented
  """
  if cls is Exercise:
    if any("is_exercise" in b.__dict__ for b in c.__mro__):
      return True
  return NotImplemented
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I then created a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> class with an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
is_exercise()</code> method.  With the help of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">__subclasshook__()
</code> and duck typing, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Ski</code> is considered a subclass of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
class Ski:

def __init__(self, time: tuple) -> None:
  self.__time = time

@property
def time(self) -> tuple:
  return self.__time

def is_exercise(self) -> bool:
  """
  Determine whether the skiing was an exercise or not.  With this method, 'Ski' is considered an 'Exercise'
  through duck typing.
  :return: True if the ski is an exercise, False otherwise
  """
  minutes, seconds = self.time
  return minutes + seconds > 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
  nordic_ski = Ski((30, 0))

  # Instances and Subclasses of Exercise via __subclasshook__()
  assert isinstance(nordic_ski, Exercise)
  assert issubclass(Ski, Exercise)
</CodeSnippet>

<p>
Python provides very flexible means of utilizing inheritance an object oriented design.  Outside of
concrete classes, ABCs are the most strict use of inheritance.  However, developers can make them
less strict with the use of virtual subclassing and duck typing with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
__subclasshook__()</code>.  If you want an extremely informal inheritance design, protocols can be
used to follow common patterns.

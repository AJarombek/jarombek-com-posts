A common problem when programming is performing a deep copy of an object or data structure.  In many
languages this is a complex problem, especially when the object gets large.  In Java there are many
different ways to perform a deep copy on an object.  The original language implementation for copying
was the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface.  Since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> was the first method for copying objects in Java, it is important to understand how it works
along with all its shortcomings.  This is my journey to understand Java’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> interface in all its complexity.
</p>
<p>
If you've ever heard or read about Java’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface
you likely were told the following three words: <strong>Don’t Use It</strong>.  This is good advice, as there
are many simpler ways to implement deep copying.  Unfortunately there is a lot of code in existence that
already uses <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>.  To understand how it works, first let’s
look at the source code for the interface:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public interface Cloneable { }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Yes that is it.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is an empty interface that defines no
methods.  While it may seem based off the interface definition that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> does nothing, it actually does quite a lot.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>
determines the implementation details of one of the methods on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>
class.  This method I'm referring to is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>, a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">protected</code> method as shown below<sup>1</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate
protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are a couple of interesting things to note about <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>.
First off it has no method body and is defined with the keyword <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
native</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">native</code> keyword means that the method is
implemented using the Java Native Interface (JNI).  This means the method body is not written in
Java, instead implemented in another language such as C, C++, or Assembly<sup>2</sup>.  The
reason for this is writing code in a low level, machine specific language increases performance.
</p>
<p>
Another important piece of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate</code> annotation.
This annotation allows the HotSpot VM (an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine) know that the
method implementation may be an intrinsic function<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="Intrinsic Function">
A function that a programming language uses which is handled by the compiler instead of the programming languages
runtime environment<sup>4</sup>.  In other words - an optimized method definition by the compiler is used, replacing
the one in the programming languages library<sup>5</sup>.  Intrinsic functions are used as an optimization technique.
</Definition>
<p>
If there is one thing to take away from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">native</code> keyword and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate</code> annotation it's that
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> is not handled by the Java language itself.  As Joshua Bloch,
creator of the Java Collections framework says, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is
extralinguistic.  It does not follow Java’s rules.
</p>
<Definition word="Extralinguistic">
Outside the bounds of a language.  In Java something that is extralinguistic is outside the rules enforced
by the language.
</Definition>
<p>
An interface with no defined methods should not be able to change a method implementation in another class.
However <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> does just that.  If a class implements
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>
method performs a deep copy on the object.  If a class does not implement
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> throws
a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CloneNotSupportedException</code>.  This should not be a legal Java
operation and is downright confusing.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Implementing Cloneable">Implementing <code className="jarombek-header-code">Cloneable</code></SectionTitle>
<p>
Here is a simple class I made in Java representing a programming language.  It contains three fields -
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">inception</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">paradigms</code>.  It also has getters and setters along with a method
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">addParadigm()</code> which mutates the list of paradigms by adding a new paradigm.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public class Language implements Cloneable {

    private String name;
    private LocalDate inception;
    private List&lt;Paradigm&gt; paradigms;

    enum Paradigm {
        Object_Oriented, Imperative, Functional, Declarative
    }

    public Language(String name, LocalDate inception, List&lt;Paradigm&gt; paradigms) {
        this.name = name;
        this.inception = inception;
        this.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(paradigms);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[" + name + ", " + inception.toString() + ", " + paradigms.toString() + "]";
    }

    /* Getters and Setters */

    // Add a paradigm to the list if a non null value is passed in
    public void addParadigm(Paradigm paradigm) {
        Optional.ofNullable(paradigm).ifPresent(p -> this.paradigms.add(p));
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here is my first attempt at overriding the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> method:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
protected Language clone() {
    try {
        return (Language) super.clone();
    } catch(CloneNotSupportedException ex) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Interestingly, the cast to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">(Language)</code> always succeeds.
On the other hand, the catch clause is never reached since we implemented <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code>, however it must be included since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code>
throws a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CloneNotSupportedException</code>.  If you are thinking to
yourself this doesn’t make much sense I agree wholeheartedly.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Cloneable</code> interface does not follow the rules that the rest of Java enforces.
</p>
<p>
I created a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> instance to try cloning.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">

Language language = new Language("Java", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.MAY, 23),
                            List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                                    Language.Paradigm.Imperative));

Language language2 = language.clone();

System.out.println(language);
System.out.println(language2);

// Name is immutable and Inception is a final singleton, so changing them
// has no impact on the copied language
language.setName("Prolog");
language.setInception(LocalDate.EPOCH);

// This mutation will effect the copy
language.addParadigm(Language.Paradigm.Declarative);

System.out.println(language);
System.out.println(language2);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Before Mutation
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]
[Java, 1995-05-23, [Object_Oriented, Imperative]]

# After Mutation
[Prolog, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative, Declarative]]
[Prolog, 1970-01-01, [Object_Oriented, Imperative, Declarative]]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Adding an item to the paradigm list in the first
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> instance actually impacts the cloned instance.  This is
because <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> does not make a deep copy of each field in
an object.  It simply copies the value assigned to the field into the clone.  In the case of an object, the
copied value is a reference to the object.  Altering the object the reference points to changes the value
in both the original and cloned instances.  Of course this is never an issue if object fields
are immutable objects (which both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">LocalDate</code> are).
</p>
<p>
To prevent mutations I added another line to the clone method.  This time a new instance of the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> is created in each clone.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@Override
protected Language clone() {
    try {
        Language language = (Language) super.clone();
        language.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(paradigms);
        return language;
    } catch(CloneNotSupportedException ex) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now the clone is not modified:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">

</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface is very confusing and does not follow the
rules of Java.  Therefore it is encouraged to avoid implementing it in your classes.  To make matters worse,
if an extendable class implements <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> all its subclasses have
to implement it as well<sup>6</sup>.  If the extendable class is client facing, other developers may have to endure
implementing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Alternatives to Cloneable">Alternatives to <code className="jarombek-header-code">Cloneable</code></SectionTitle>
<p>
Since we know that implementing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> is a bad idea, what
are the alternatives?  The two best choices for copying an object are copy constructors and copy static
factories.  Both take an existing object as an argument and return a copy of that object.
They can be used together, as shown below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
/* Copy Constructor */
public Language(Language language) {
    this.name = language.name;
    this.inception = language.inception;
    this.paradigms = new ArrayList<>(language.paradigms);
}

/* Copy Static Factory Method */
public static Language create(Language language) {
    return new Language(language);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Copy constructors and copy static factories are within the bounds of the Java language, making them excellent
alternatives.  Use them!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Valid uses of clone">Valid uses of <code className="jarombek-header-code">clone()</code></SectionTitle>
<p>
Because the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface has been in Java since version 1.0, you
are likely to see code that uses it.  There are indeed some use cases of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
clone()</code> that are quite useful.  One of the use cases is copying an array.  Using
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> is generally the fastest way to copy an array, and is the
recommended approach<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
String[] strings = new String[2];
strings[0] = "Whats";
strings[1] = "Up";

String[] stringsCopy = strings.clone();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Remember that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">clone()</code> does not perform a deep copy on
objects within a class or array.  If you mutate an object within a class or array that was cloned, the mutation
occurs in both the original and the copy.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
Language[] languages = new Language[2];

languages[0] = new Language("Java", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.MAY, 23),
                    List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                            Language.Paradigm.Imperative));

languages[1] = new Language("JavaScript", LocalDate.of(1995, Month.DECEMBER, 4),
                    List.of(Language.Paradigm.Object_Oriented,
                            Language.Paradigm.Imperative,
                            Language.Paradigm.Functional));

// Clone array of mutable languages
Language[] languagesCopy = languages.clone();

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languages));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languagesCopy));

// Change the date Java was created to the epoch
languagesCopy[0].setInception(LocalDate.EPOCH);

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languages));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(languagesCopy));
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">

<p>
Yet another reason to use immutable objects!

That is all I have to share on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cloneable</code> interface, its strange
behavior, and the alternatives.  The code used for this discovery is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/

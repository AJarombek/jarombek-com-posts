Recently I worked on a project which required some basic command line scripting.  One of the VMs
I worked on was a Windows box, and the scripts consisted of Batch files.  Although I'd seen a few
Batch scripts before in my short software development career (~2.3 years), I never actually got a
chance to write one myself.  I figured this was the perfect opportunity to take a look at the
basics of Batch scripting.  With some knowledge of how to write a Batch script, I'll be capable of
comparing Batch to scripts in PowerShell and Bash.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is a Batch Script?">What is a Batch Script?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Batch scripts are pieces of code written in a command line interface (shell) on the Windows
operating system.  For someone new to programming like myself, I always thought of Batch as the
precursor to PowerShell.  This actually forms a pretty good one sentence comparison between
Batch and PowerShell.  Although you will often hear developers advocating the switch from Batch to
PowerShell, Batch scripting is far from extinct<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Batch scripts first appeared in the DOS family of operating systems and are still used in Microsoft
operating systems today<sup>2</sup>.  On today's Windows operating systems Batch scripts are
executed in the cmd.exe CLI<sup>3</sup>.  You can write commands on the command prompt or store a
text file of commands in a Batch file.  Batch files allow for reusable command sequences.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Batch File Basics">Batch File Basics</SectionTitle>
<p>
When running batch files, each line is executed in order.  A batch file is run by simply executing
the file path in cmd.exe.  Arguments can be passed to the batch file.  For example, the following
command executes the batch file test.bat with the argument "Hello."  All the program does is print
the argument to standard output.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
@echo off

echo The first command passed: %1
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
> test.bat Hello
The first command passed: Hello
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Interestingly the default behavior of batch scripts is to print out all the commands that were
executed.  Usually this isn't preferable (except for debugging circumstances) so suppressing print
statements is accomplished with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@echo off</code> command
<sup>4</sup>.  Arguments are accessed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
%&lt;arg-number&gt;</code> command, and later on I will use this same syntax to access function
arguments in Batch.
</p>
<p>
Batch scripts also allow you to interact with strings and integer numbers.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">set</code> command is used to assign a value to a variable.
Variables can then be accessed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">%variable-name%</code>
syntax.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
set name=Andrew Jarombek
echo %name%

:: Extract a substring starting at character 0 and ending at character 6
set firstName=%name:~0,6%
echo "%firstName%"

:: Alternative way to get the first name with negative character indexing
set firstName=%name:~0,-9%
echo "%firstName%"

:: Extract a substring of all characters beyond position 7
set lastName=%name:~7%
echo "%lastName%"

:: String replacement with :substringToRemove=replacementString notation
set fakeName=%name:Jarombek=Jarbek%
echo %fakeName%

:: Use /a with numeric values
set /a age=23
set /a ten=10

set /a ageInTenYears=%age% + %ten%
echo "Age in 10 Years:" %ageInTenYears%
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Andrew Jarombek
"Andrew"
"Andrew"
"Jarombek"
Andrew Jarbek
Age in 10 Years: 33
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Unfortunately, I quickly learned that working directly with floating point arithmetic in Batch is
much more difficult.  I won't include any examples in this post, however it is an interesting topic
to explore<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Batch also allows you to set inner scopes for a script.  Unfortunately the syntax isn't quite as
concise as C-like curly brackets (Batch requires a more verbose <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
setlocal</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">endlocal</code> syntax).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
set /a age=23

setlocal
set age=24
echo Age within Local Scope: %age%
endlocal

echo Age outside of Local Scope: %age%
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Age within Local Scope: 24
Age outside of Local Scope: 23
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see that any variables defined in the inner scope are not accessible to the outer scope and
more importantly don't modify any of the existing outer scope variables.
</p>
<p>
Bash also has support for array data structures.  This is also where I ran into the first major
"gotcha" of Batch programming.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
set towns[0]=Greenwich
set towns[1]=New Canaan
set towns[2]=Darien
set towns[3]=Wilton
set towns[4]=Ridgefield

echo %towns[0]%

set numberList=0 1 2 3 4

setlocal enableDelayedExpansion

for %%i in (%numberList%) do (
  set allTowns=!allTowns! !towns[%%i]!
)

echo %allTowns%

for %%i in (0 2 4) do (
  set someTowns=!someTowns! !towns[%%i]!
)

echo %someTowns%
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Greenwich
Greenwich New Canaan Darien Wilton Ridgefield
Greenwich Darien Ridgefield
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The code above creates an array of towns in my home state of Connecticut.  It first prints the town
at index 0 in the array, and then goes on to loop through the array, creating a string of all the
town names.  The first <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop uses an array defined
elsewhere to loop through.  The second <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop is more
concise and defines an array to loop through inside the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
for</code> loop syntax itself.
</p>
<p>
The two points of interest in the code above are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
set allTowns=!allTowns!  !towns[%%i]!</code>.  The exclamation point variable access syntax and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">setlocal enableDelayedExpansion</code> are related in an
unexpected way.
</p>
<p>
The code samples I've shown you so far access values of variables through the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">%variable-name%</code> syntax.  In Batch
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">%variable-name%</code> defines variable expansion.  Variable
expansion is the act of replacing a variable reference with its actual value.  That means if you
created a variable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">set age=23</code> and then accessed it with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">%age%</code>, the token <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
%age%</code> actually gets replaced with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">23</code>.  This
replacement occurs when a line in a Batch script is parsed, not when it's finally executed.
</p>
<p>
Variable expansion with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">%variable-name%</code> syntax
only happens once when the line it occurs on is parsed<sup>6</sup>.  The value the
variable is replaced with never changes.
</p>
<p>
Obviously this causes issues in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loops.  With
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">%variable-name%</code> syntax the value in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop will never change!  This breaks from the
behavior you come to expect from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loops.  Variable
expansion side effects is one of the most common beginner mistakes with Batch, and I fell victim
to it<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to use delayed variable expansion by executing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion</code>.  With delayed variable expansion and the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">!variable-name!</code> syntax, variables are expanded each time
a line is executed.  In the case of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loops, this
occurs on each loop iteration<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting construct you can make in Batch scripts are functions.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
:displayTime
echo The current time is %TIME%
exit /b 0

call :displayTime
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
The current time is 15:45:28.41
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The above function (beginning at <code className="jarombek-inline-code">:displayTime</code> and ending
at <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exit /b 0</code>) simply prints out the current time.  The
interesting thing is that while the
above construct can be treated as a function, it is actually a subprogram inside a Batch script.
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">call</code> command invokes one Batch program from another
<sup>9</sup>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">call</code> command is like having a bunch of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">goto</code> statements in your code, jumping around to different
labels.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">:displayTime</code> happens to be the label for my
function.  This behavior in Batch reminds me of my time working with assembly, or if I really wanted
very poorly designed Java code.  The following more complex function drives this point home.  You
can follow the execution flow through the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">call</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">goto</code> commands, jumping between labels.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Batch">
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion

call :stringTimes cat 3
echo %result%
goto :eof

:stringTimes - 'A function to multiply a string a certain number of times and return the result'
  setlocal

  set string=%1
  set /a count=%2
  set finalString=%string%

  :stringTimesLoop
  if %count% gtr 1 (
    set finalString=%finalString%%string%
    set /a count=%count% - 1
    goto :stringTimesLoop
  )

  endlocal & set result=%finalString%
  goto :eof
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
catcatcat
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Obviously we know that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">goto</code> commands are difficult to
follow in our code.  This behavior in Batch makes me wonder how Bash and PowerShell handle
functions and script traversal.
</p>
<p>
I felt like I learned a lot about command line scripting the past few days, but obviously I have a
long way to go.  I just scratched the surface of Batch files, and still seek a greater
understanding of Bash and PowerShell.  I hope to research them further and compare their features
in the future.

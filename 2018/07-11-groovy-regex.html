Using regular expressions for pattern matching is a task software developers perform on a
regular basis.  Although regular expressions still differ a bit across languages, they
are standardized to the point where they are language agnostic.  However, interacting with these
regular expressions differs greatly across different programming languages.  In my recent ventures
into Groovy, I saw a very unique approach to handling regular expressions.  I decided to compare
the approach in Groovy to approaches in other languages I often use.  This article shares my
findings.
</p>
<Definition word="Language Agnostic">
A concept that is independent from any single programming language implementation.  Skills that
are language agnostic can be applied throughout the software development ecosystem.
</Definition>
<p>
Java is the natural language comparison to Groovy, so I explored Java's regular expression
libraries in this article.  I also included snippets from JavaScript since it is my most used
language this year.
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/07-jul/
7-11-groovy-regex">GitHub</a> there are matching examples from Python, Swift, and PHP.
After working through examples in all the languages above, the most difficult one to implement
regular expression matching in was Swift.  This may not come as much of a surprise
considering the convoluted <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-3-2018-string-swift">nature of
strings in Swift</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking of including C in the list of languages to test regular expressions.  However,
ANSI C does not have regular expressions with the syntax we expect in the modern day<sup>1</sup>.
Instead if you want to use the regular expressions we are accustomed to an external library must be
used.  For this reason I decided not to use C.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The Anatomy of a Regular Expression">The Anatomy of a Regular Expression</SectionTitle>
<p>
Regular expressions are used in two stages - compilation and execution (also referred to as
matching).  The compilation stage parses the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">String</code>
representation of a regular expression<sup>2</sup>.  The structure of a regular expression after
it is parsed takes the form of a single state in a finite-state machine<sup>3</sup>.  The
process of compiling a regular expression can take a long time - much longer than executing it.
This execution stage is what looks for matches on a string.
</p>
<Definition word="Finite-State Machine">
A data structure or machine that is always in one state out of a finite number<sup>3</sup>.  The
state of the machine is only affected by a series of input values.  If the machine is
deterministic (which the regular expression finite-machine likely is), a given input will always
produce the same output<sup>4</sup>.  For the example of a regular expression, a given string
pattern will always result in the same state of the regular expressions finite-state machine.
</Definition>
<p>
Because of the huge contrast between the execution time of compilation and execution, these two
operations are often separated for optimization.  With the two stages split, the result of a
regular expression compilation can be reused for all pattern matches.  This saves time since the
pattern matches themselves are quick.
</p>
<p>
Many languages separate out compilation and execution by default (such as JavaScript).  Others
let you choose if you want to split the two steps or keep them together (Java and Groovy).  Next
I will Introduce the basic concepts for compiling and executing regular expressions in Java,
Groovy, and JavaScript.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Exact and Existence Matches">Exact and Existence Matches</SectionTitle>
<p>
In Java the package <code class="jarombek-inline-code">java.util.regex</code> is used for
handling regular expressions.  The two key classes are <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Pattern</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher</code>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern</code> is the result of a regular expressions
compilation and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher</code> executes (or performs matching
operations) on a string with a pattern.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at an example and explore these two classes in more detail.  The following code creates
a regular expression that represents a date and then tries to perform an exact match on four
different strings:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
String dateRegex = "\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}";

String today = "7/11/2018";
String tomorrow = "Tomorrow is 7/12/2018.";
String endOfYear = "12/31/2018";
String myBirthday = "Feb. 26, 2018";

// Test strings for exact matches
assert today.matches(dateRegex);
assert !tomorrow.matches(dateRegex);
assert Pattern.matches(dateRegex, endOfYear);
assert !Pattern.matches(dateRegex, myBirthday);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Two different methods are used to match the string to the regular expression.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.matches(regex)</code> is invoked on the string instance.
Alternatively the static method <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.matches(regex, string)
</code> can be invoked to the same result.  If you look at the Java source code for
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">String.matches(regex)</code>, its method body simply contains
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">return Pattern.matches(regex, this);</code>  Both return a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">boolean</code> value detailing whether the entire string
matched the regular expression.
</p>
<p>
What's more interesting is the method body for <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Pattern.match(regex, string)</code>.  Here is a peek at the Java source code in Pattern.java.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public static boolean matches(String regex, CharSequence input) {
  Pattern p = Pattern.compile(regex);
  Matcher m = p.matcher(input);
  return m.matches();
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.matches(regex, string)</code> is composed of multiple
steps.  First the compile step of the regular expression is invoked with
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.compile()</code>.  Once the regular expression is
compiled into a state in the finite-state machine, an instance of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher</code> is created by invoking
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.matcher()</code>.  Finally the entire string can be
matched to the regular expression with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher.matches()</code>.
At this point both compilation and execution (matching) steps are complete and a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">boolean</code> value of whether or not the string matched the
regular expression is returned.
</p>
<p>
The important thing to note about this code is that both compilation and execution steps are
combined into one function.  In the previous code, this means the compilation step is run four
times and the execution step is run four times.  Running the compilation steps multiple times
is a waste since it returns the same state in the finite-state machine each time.  Also remember
that the compile step is very slow compared to the execution step.  A better approach would be to
separate out the compile step from the execution step - effectively caching the state of the
finite-state machine for multiple usages.  The following code which searches for existence of a
regular expression match does just that.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
String dateRegex = "\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}";

String today = "7/11/2018";
String tomorrow = "Tomorrow is 7/12/2018.";
String endOfYear = "12/31/2018";
String myBirthday = "Feb. 26, 2018";

Pattern datePattern = Pattern.compile(dateRegex);

Matcher todayMatcher = datePattern.matcher(today);
Matcher tomorrowMatcher = datePattern.matcher(tomorrow);
Matcher endOfYearMatcher = datePattern.matcher(endOfYear);
Matcher myBirthdayMatcher = datePattern.matcher(myBirthday);

assert todayMatcher.find();
assert tomorrowMatcher.find();
assert endOfYearMatcher.find();
assert !myBirthdayMatcher.find();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Invocations to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.compile()</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.matcher()</code> are now separated out into two steps.
The result of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.compile()</code> is reused for all
pattern matches.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher.find()</code> is the method which
attempts to find a subsequence that matches the regular expression pattern.
</p>
<p>
It is important to remember that Java gives you the
option to combine the compilation and execution steps into a single method or separate them.
Java expects the developer to know how regular expressions work under the hood, and optimize based
on their knowledge of the compilation and execution phases.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Groovy">Groovy</SectionTitle>
<p>
Groovy does its best to simplify the usage of regular expressions, although under the hood it uses
Java's <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Matcher</code> classes.  Groovy is actually unique in my experience with programming languages in
regards to regular expressions.  Groovy uses three operators to help with building regular
expression patterns, matching a pattern to a string, and finding all pattern matches in a string.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Regular Expression Operators">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Find Operator <code class="jarombek-header-code">=~</code>
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Checks to see if a pattern matches any substring within a string.  The value before the operand is
the string to look for a match on.  The value after the operand is the regular expression to match
against a substring.  For example, both <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
"02-26" =~ /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
"02-26-2018" =~ /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/</code> will return <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
true</code> while <code class="jarombek-inline-code">"Andy" =~ /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/</code> will
return <code class="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>.
</p>
<p>
The find operator is equivalent to invoking <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(string)</code> to get an instance of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher</code> and then calling
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher.find()</code> on the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Matcher</code> instance.  Since all these operations are combined into one step, the compilation of
the regex is not cached for future use.  The find operator should be used if the regular expression
is only compiled once in the project.  Otherwise, the compilation step should be separated out with
the pattern operator for reuse.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Match Operator <code class="jarombek-header-code">==~</code>
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Checks to see if a pattern matches an entire string.  The value before the operand is the
string to look for a match on.  The value after the operand is the regular expression to match
against the entire string.  For example, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
"02-26" ==~ /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/</code> will return <code class="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>
while <code class="jarombek-inline-code">"02-26-2018" ==~ /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/</code> will return
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the match operator is equivalent to calling <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Pattern.matches(regex, string)</code> in Java.  Therefore, this operator combines compilation and
execution into a single step.  A match operator should be used if a regular expression is only
compiled once in the project.  Otherwise, the compilation step should be separated out with the
pattern operator for reuse.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Pattern Operator <code class="jarombek-header-code">~string</code>
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The pattern operator transforms a string it is applied to into an instance of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern</code><sup>6</sup>.  Patterns are a result of the
compilation stage of a regular expression.  Therefore, a pattern is a state in the regular
expressions finite-state machine.  The benefit of separating the compiling phase into its own
operand is to cache the pattern for multiple uses, since determining the state of a regular
expression based off its string representation is a slow task.
</p>
<p>
An example of the pattern operator is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
~/([a-zA-Z]{5-10})/</code>.  The result is a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Pattern</code> object of the regular expression.

<p>
The following code displays how to use the find, match, and pattern operators in Groovy.  The
functionality matches the Java regular expression code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
/* Basic Regex pattern matching and finding for existence */

def datePattern = /\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4}/

def today = '7/11/2018'
def tomorrow = 'Tomorrow is 7/12/2018.'
def endOfYear = '12/31/2018'
def myBirthday = 'Feb. 26, 2018'

// Test if the entire string matches the pattern
assert today ==~ datePattern
assert !(tomorrow ==~ datePattern)
assert endOfYear ==~ datePattern
assert !(myBirthday ==~ datePattern)

// Test if the pattern exists in the string
assert today =~ datePattern
assert tomorrow =~ datePattern
assert endOfYear =~ datePattern
assert !(myBirthday =~ datePattern)

/* Optimization to split pattern creation time and pattern matching time */

def pattern = ~datePattern

assert pattern.matcher(today).matches()
assert !(tomorrow in pattern)
assert pattern.isCase(endOfYear)
assert !pattern.matcher(myBirthday).matches()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Under the optimization section that uses the pattern operator, multiple different approaches are
used to check for matches.  The typical implementation is to chain calls to the Java methods
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Pattern.matcher(string)</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Matcher.matches()</code>, although alternatives are also
available.
</p>
<p>
Groovy takes Java's approach to regular expressions and simplifies the syntax with the use of
operators.  Groovy developers simply use the find, match, and pattern operators instead
of learning the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">java.util.regex</code> API.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="JavaScript">JavaScript</SectionTitle>
<p>
JavaScript takes a different approach to the compilation and execution phases of regular
expressions.  The compilation phase of regular expressions occurs when the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">RegExp</code> object is first created<sup>6</sup>.  This can
occur at different points in time depending on whether a regular expression literal or constructor
function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">RegExp(string)</code> is used to declare the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">RegExp</code> object.
</p>
<p>
Regular expression literals are the preferred approach because the JavaScript engine precompiles
them into a state and caches the state before the code is run<sup>7</sup>.  The alternative
compiles the regular expression at runtime.
</p>
<p>
The following code matches the functionality of the Java and Groovy examples.  Regular expression
literals are used to take advantage of cached regular expression patterns.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const assert = (assertion) => {
  console.assert(assertion, `Assertion failed!`);
};

const datePattern = /\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4}/;
const exactDatePattern = /^\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4}$/;

const today = '7/11/2018';
const tomorrow = 'Tomorrow is 7/12/2018.';
const endOfYear = '12/31/2018';
const myBirthday = 'Feb. 26, 2018';

/* Exact matches */
assert(exactDatePattern.test(today));
assert(!exactDatePattern.test(tomorrow));
assert(exactDatePattern.test(endOfYear));
assert(!exactDatePattern.test(myBirthday));

/* Pattern existence match */
assert(datePattern.test(today));
assert(datePattern.test(tomorrow));
assert(datePattern.test(endOfYear));
assert(!datePattern.test(myBirthday));
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One thing to note about the JavaScript implementation is that exact matches vs existence matches
are handled in the regular expression string instead of the JavaScript regex API.  Both exact and
existence matches use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">RegExp.test(string)</code> method.
</p>

<SectionTitle title="How Does Groovy Stack Up?">How Does Groovy Stack Up?</SectionTitle>
<p>
So how does Groovy stack up against other languages I have used in regards to regular expressions?
Groovy simplifies Java's regular expression functionality - which itself it very flexible albeit
a bit verbose.  Groovy's use of operators for regular expression compilation and execution phases
puts the language in a very unique position.  The inclusion of regular expressions in Groovy's
operators - the most basic actions of the language - sets the tone for Groovy's intentions for
simplifying regular expressions.
</p>
<p>
Since regular expressions are often a pain point for software developers (I've admittedly spent
countless hours testing different regex implementations for often simple tasks), anything that
makes their use easier is a welcome addition.  I look forward to using regular expressions and
other Groovy features in the future.

Over the last year or so I've heard whispers about a technology called GraphQL.  GraphQL is
marketed as an alternative for the REST API which so many of our applications use these days
(all my websites/mobile apps use different REST APIs).  I decided that I'd heard enough about
GraphQL and it was time to try it out and form my own opinions.
</p>
<p>
I created a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/
08-Aug/8-5-graphql">prototype GraphQL API</a> in JavaScript.  There was a bit more development work
 for the GraphQL prototype then I anticipated, so I am splitting up my GraphQL research across
two separate discovery posts.  The post you are reading now serves as an introduction to the GraphQL
ecosystem and compares it to the humble REST API.  The follow up post will look at my work
developing a GraphQL prototype.

<p>
GraphQL was created to fix certain flaws of the REST API.  However, there is no denying the
greatness of the REST API in software development.  Almost all production applications use or expose
a REST API these days as a way to transfer resources across different services.
</p>
<Definition word="REST API">
<p>
The REST API definition can easily be broken down into its two components, REST (representational
state transfer) and API (application programming interface).
</p>
<p>
An API is an exposed set of methods or processes that can be communicated with from an outside
application.  For example, in object oriented programming a class has public methods that other
outside objects can call to perform some logic.  These exposed public methods make up the classes
API.
</p>
<p>
REST is an architectural style that usually uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as its
underlying data transfer mechanism<sup>1</sup>.  The REST architecture is used to define APIs with
the use of endpoints (URIs).    This means that a REST API will expose a bunch of URIs that outside
applications can call over HTTP.  For example, a RESTful URI called
<strong>http://api.cats.com/bengal</strong> may return data on bengal cats.
</p>
<p>
Most REST APIs are simply CRUD applications, which expose create, read, update, and delete
operations through different HTTP verbs<sup>2</sup>.  The HTTP verbs for CRUD are
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">POST</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PUT</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DELETE</code>
respectively.  A HTTP <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code> request is made every time you
type a URL into a web browser.
</p>
</Definition>
<p>
The great thing about REST APIs is their simplicity.  Even people without technical knowledge of
software can easily understand how they work.  In the internet age nearly everyone uses HTTP on a
daily basis, making REST APIs an easy learning curve.
</p>
<p>
REST APIs are also very simple and predictable thanks to the HTTP protocols stateless nature.  This
allows for many of the HTTP verbs to be idempotent.
</p>
<Definition word="Idempotent">
An operation is idempotent when it can be called multiple times and always return the same result as
the initial invocation<sup>3</sup>.  An idempotent operation also should not change the state of the
application beyond the initial call.  Idempotence enables predictable results.  For example, an HTTP
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code> call is idempotent as the returned value is always the
same and no data in the application will change because of the request.
</Definition>

<p>
While REST APIs are a great software architecture and work extremely well in most applications, they
do have some drawbacks as an application expands.  The list of HTTP endpoints in a REST API can
quickly get very large and the URLs can get extremely long.  Lots of documentation is needed to
cover all the endpoints.  Often an application that consumes a REST API will have to make multiple
endpoint calls to get all the data it needs.
</p>
<p>
There is also an issue with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code> HTTP method as a means
of querying data.  While many HTTP verbs allow for a request body to send an application necessary
data, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code> does not allow a request body.  All your
querying information needs to be in the URL itself, which can quickly get out of control.  A hack
around for this problem is to use an HTTP <code className="jarombek-inline-code">POST</code> request for
querying instead of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET</code> - allowing the placement of query
information in the request body.  Unfortunately this hack breaks the simplicity and elegance of
the CRUD model.
</p>
<p>
GraphQL is a query language for your API.  In GraphQL you define a schema for your API to follow
along with all the data types it handles<sup>4</sup>.  Then in the programming language of your
choice you create functions to help GraphQL return the proper data for each query.
</p>
<p>
The big draw of GraphQL comes from the APIs client perspective.  In order to query or manipulate
data in an API, the client simply sends GraphQL the structure of the data it wants and the rest is
handled by the API application.  Querying GraphQL is a single call, while querying a REST API
may require multiple calls to get the same data.
</p>

<p>
I think the differences between GraphQL and REST are better explained with an example.  Let's take
a website that handles running logs for cross country runners.  The application has two layers - the
front end code that defines the user interface and the back end code consisting of an API and a
database.  We have two choices for the backend API - REST and GraphQL.
</p>
<p>
As an example, let's say a user navigated to a runners profile page.  On this page we want to
display the runners name, their weekly mileage, and their last three runs.
</p>
<p>
First up is the REST API.  Depending on how the API was set up, all this data may come from
multiple different endpoints:
</p>
<figure>
  <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-5-18-restapi.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
While building the application, setup with the REST API was a breeze and extremely easy for all
the developers and business folks alike.  However, note some of the drawbacks here.  First off
the data was retrieved in three HTTP calls instead of one.  Network calls are often the slowest part
of an application, so reducing them is often a solid action plan.  Also these endpoints gave back
some excess information that the client doesn't need in its current state.  The frontend profile
page doesn't need to know the runners mileage last week and only requires three runs instead of the
provided five.  The structure of the data received back from the endpoint is static.
</p>
<p>
Next up is GraphQL:
</p>
<figure>
  <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-5-18-graphql.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Note that while querying GraphQL the client explicitly tells the backend API what data it wants,
and GraphQL returns nothing more.  This makes GraphQL extremely flexible compared to REST.  Also,
only one API call was made, reducing the time spent on network calls.  Setting up GraphQL for the
application was more complex and the non-technical folks don't exactly understand how it works, but
the end result is quite elegant.

No GraphQL code has been shown yet, but hopefully you have a better understanding of the
benefits and drawbacks of GraphQL.  The next post in the series will look at the GraphQL
language and how to set up a GraphQL API in JavaScript.  If you want a head start, the code for the
GraphQL API is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/

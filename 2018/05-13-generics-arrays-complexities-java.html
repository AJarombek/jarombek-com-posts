Usually when I work in Java generics are easy to reason about.  They enforce types
on a collection or a class I created.  When declaring a class with a generic, an instance of that
class can be parameterized with one (or more) element types.  A simple example is an
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code>, which is implemented with a generic parameter like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">

public class ArrayList&lt;E&gt; extends AbstractList&lt;E&gt; implements List&lt;E&gt; {
    ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Note that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> extends <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AbstractList</code> and implements
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AbstractList</code>
actually implements <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> itself, so the definition of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">implements &lt;List&gt;</code> is not needed.  It is only
there for clarity and readability.
</p>
<p>
You can create an instance of an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> with a type:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;Number&gt; numberList = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();

// Java 7 introduced the diamond operator, allowing the
// compiler to infer the type based on the definition
List&lt;Number&gt; numberList2 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Easy right?  But what happens if I change the generic assignment to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Integer</code>?  My first thought was it should work, since  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer
</code> is a subclass of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;Number&gt; n2 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); // Incompatible Types
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code actually fails, saying that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> are incompatible types.  This is because of a unique
implementation detail of generics.  Generics are invariant, meaning that two generic type parameters are
neither supertypes or subtypes of one another.  That means <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is not a subtype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Number&gt;</code>,
they are simply not equal.  Therefore, the above assignment statement is invalid.
</p>
<UpdateInfo date="February 3rd, 2019">
While generics are invariant by default in C#, they can also be covariant and contravariant.  I wrote
an article about <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-3-2019-variance-csharp-generics">Variance
with C# Generics</a> if you want to learn more.
</UpdateInfo>
<p>
It is important to note that object assignments still enable polymorphism when using generics.  In the
example above an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> was still assigned to a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>.
</p>
<Definition word="Covariant">
When a programming language type system allows variables to be assigned any type less than
(subtype) or equal to the variables declared type<sup>1</sup>.  In Java, obviously a type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> can be assigned to a variable defined as type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Object&gt;
 list = new List&lt;&gt;();</code>.  This follows the second part of the rule when the types are equal.
You can also assign any subtype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>, such as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code>.  This follows the first part of the rule.  Arrays in
Java are also covariant such that the following assignment is legal: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Number[] array = new Integer[1];</code>
</Definition>
<Definition word="Contravariant">
When a programming language type system allows variables to be assigned any type greater than
(supertype) or equal to the variables declared type.  Java is not contravariant and the compiler throws an
error when a supertype is assigned to a declaration.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Invariant">
When a type in a programming language is neither a supertype or subtype of any other type.  In Java generics
follow invariance, so a generic type assignment can only correspond to a generic type declaration of the same type.
For example the following assignment is valid: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Number&gt; numberList =
 new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();</code>.  The work around for generics invariance is generic wildcards.
</Definition>
<p>
Unlike generics, arrays are covariant.  This sounds nice but can lead to issues around type safety.
Let's look at one of the issues with covariant arrays in Java:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// Will Compile and Run, but throws a java.lang.ArrayStoreException
Number[] array = new Integer[1];
array[0] = 1.6;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
What happens here is you can assign an array a value of any subtype.  However, when the array was
initialized it was given the type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>.  While
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">1.6</code> is a valid number, it is not a valid integer.  Therefore we
get an unfortunate exception at runtime.  Note that the code above compiles cleanly - the error is only
noticeable when running the program.  At that point its too late!
</p>
<p>
Generics were designed (unlike arrays) to spot errors at compile time.  Therefore type
safety is ensured before running a program.  The big difference between generics and arrays is that
generics implement erasure and are non-reifiable while arrays are reified.  Because of these differences
arrays and generics do not mix well.  In fact, if you try to mix them it will not work.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
/* You can't mix generics and arrays - the following are illegal */
List&lt;Number&gt;[] arr1 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()[10];
List&lt;?&gt;[] array = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;[10];
</CodeSnippet>
<Definition word="Reified">
Something abstract that is made more concrete or real.  In
terms of programming languages a reified variable is one that knows its type at runtime and doesn't
lose any type information at runtime.  The type
is 'real' while the program is executing.  In Java, variables that are reified know their type and also enforce it at runtime.
Arrays are reified - they enforce their type at runtime and don't complain at compile time.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Non-Reifiable">
The opposite of reified - something abstract which is not made concrete.  In a programming language
a non-reifiable variable is one that does not know or enforce its type at runtime (its type is abstract, not
concrete)<sup>2</sup>.  It only knows it's type at compile time.  Therefore, it looses information about
itself when it is compiled.  Although we don't know a generics type at runtime, we know its type safe
because it passed a compile time check.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Erasure">
The process of removing type constraints when code is compiled.  When a variable is implemented with erasure,
its type is checked at compile time and not at runtime<sup>3</sup>.  At runtime it does not know what type it
is.  This is how generics are implemented in Java.
</Definition>
<p>
The fact that generics are non-reifiable means only type safe code can
compile.  It is impossible to check the type safety of generics at runtime!  The sooner a developer
knows something is wrong with their code the better. Generics follow this philosophy elegantly.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Wildcards">Wildcards</SectionTitle>
<p>
When dealing with generic wildcards a lot of interesting behavior occurs.  There are two types of wildcards -
 unbounded and bounded.  Unbounded wildcards are of any type, while bounded wildcards are of any type
within a specified class hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
The problem with assigning generic instances to an unbounded wildcard type is its impossible to know
the type at runtime (it could be an instance of any class!).  This uncertainty means a lot of
operations are not allowed since they are not type safe.  Luckily errors for these scenarios occur at compile time.  Take an
example of unbounded wildcard lists:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;?&gt; uwList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;?&gt; uwList2 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();

/* Invalid operation */
uwList.add("hi");

/* Invalid operation */
uwList2.add(1);

List&lt;?&gt; uwList3 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(List.of("hi", "there"));

/* Invalid operation */
String hi = uwList3.get(0);

/* Valid operations */
var hi = uwList3.get(0);
Object there = uwList3.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the previous code both adding to lists and assigning a list element to a type variable are
disallowed.  Adding to an unbounded generic list is illegal because its impossible to know if a value
of the correct type is added.  Similarly there is no guarantee that a declared variable type is equal to
the type of an unbounded generic list.  Therefore both these operations are disallowed.
</p>
<p>
However you can assign a list element to a variable of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>
or use Java 10's <code className="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> keyword.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly unbounded wildcards are reified (unlike all other generics) in the sense that they don't
lose any type information at runtime.  However this does not mean they
know their type at runtime.  The truth is unbounded wildcards never know their type (even at compile time), so
there is no type information to lose in the first place!<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
Interesting behavior spills over into bounded wildcards:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n4 = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n5 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n6 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); // ERROR: Incompatible Types

List&lt;? extends Number&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(1,4,6));

/* Invalid operation */
numbers.add(1);

/* Valid operation */
Number number = numbers.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The syntax <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> defines a generic type
of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any subtype of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code>, such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>.  In the code above assigning the
subtype <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is valid but
assigning the supertype <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> is not.
</p>
<p>
The confusing part is what comes next.  Adding another integer to the list
fails.  This is because its impossible to guarantee that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">numbers</code>
is actually a list of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>, even though it was assigned
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> values.  If you think about it this makes sense.  The
list can be a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any subclass.  This means that is could
be an integer, but it also could be a double, float, or some other complex number type.  There is simply
no way of guaranteeing type safety, and once the code is compiled all type information is lost.
</p>
<p>
However, it is known that the value of a list element is of type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any of its subtypes.  Therefore it is valid to assign a
list element to type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another kind of unbounded wildcard works with supertypes:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n7 = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n8 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); // ERROR: Incompatible Types
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n8 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();

List&lt;? super Number&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(5, 6, 7));

/* Valid operation */
nums.add(8);

/* Invalid operation */
Number num = nums.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The syntax <code className="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code>
defines a generic type of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any supertype of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>, such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
In the code above using the supertype <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> for
the assignment is valid but using the subtype <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is not.
</p>
<p>
Adding to the list works without error because an
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is always a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or
any of its supertypes (such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>).  Thanks to
polymorphism, an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code> and an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
</p>
<p>
The type in the list still isn't guaranteed, and for that reason a list item can't be assigned to type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code>.  For example, if the list contains
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> values the assignment statement is invalid - an
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> is not a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code><sup>5</sup>.

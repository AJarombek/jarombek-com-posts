Usually when I work in Java generics are easy to reason about.  They are there to enforce type
on a collection or a class that I created.  When declaring a class with a generic, it means that an instance of the
class can be parameterized with one (or more) of many different element types.  A simple example would be an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code>, which is implemented with a generic parameter like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">

public class ArrayList&lt;E&gt; extends AbstractList&lt;E&gt; implements List&lt;E&gt; {
    ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Note that the class extends <code class="jarombek-inline-code">AbstractList</code> and implements
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">AbstractList</code>
actually implements <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> itself, so the definition of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">implements &lt;List&gt;</code> is not needed in this case.  It is only
there for clarity and readability.
</p>
<p>
You can create an instance of an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> with a type:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;Number&gt; numberList = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();

// Java 7 introduced the diamond operator, allowing the
// compiler to infer the type based on the definition
List&lt;Number&gt; numberList2 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Easy right?  But what would happen if I changed the generic assignment to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Integer</code>?  My first thought was it should work, since  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer
</code> is a subclass of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;Number&gt; n2 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); // Incompatible Types
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code actually fails, saying that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> are incompatible types.  This is because of a unique
implementation detail of generics.  Generics are invariant, meaning that two generic type parameters are
neither supertypes or subtypes of one another.  That means <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is not a subtype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Number&gt;</code>,
they are simply not equal.  Therefore, the above assignment statement is invalid.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that the class assignment still enables polymorphism when using generics.  In the
example shown an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> was still assigned to a
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>.
</p>
<Definition word="Covariant">
When a programming language type system follows a rule that a variable can be assigned any type less than
(subtype) or equal to the variables declared type<sup>1</sup>.  In Java, obviously a type
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> can be assigned to a variable defined as type
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Object&gt;
 list = new List&lt;&gt;();</code>.  This follows the first part of the rule when the types are equal.
You can also assign any subtype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List</code>, such as
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code>.  This follows the second part of the rule.  Arrays in
Java are also covariant such that the following assignment is legal: <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Number[] array = new Integer[1];</code>
</Definition>
<Definition word="Contravariant">
When a programming language type system follows a rule that a variable can be assigned any type greater than
(supertype) or equal to the variables declared type.  Java is not contravariant and the compiler will throw an
error if you try to assign a supertype to a declaration.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Invariant">
When a type in a programming language is neither a supertype or subtype of any other type.  In Java generics
follow invariance, so a generic type assignment can only correspond to a generic type declaration of the same type.
For example the following assignment is valid: <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;Number&gt; numberList =
 new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();</code>.  The way around generics invariance is to use generic wildcards.
</Definition>
<p>
Unlike generics, arrays are covariant.  This may sound nice but it can lead to some issues around type safety.
Let’s look at one of the issues with covariant arrays in Java:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// Will Compile and Run, but will throw a java.lang.ArrayStoreException
Number[] array = new Integer[1];
array[0] = 1.6;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
What happens here is you can assign an array a value of any subtype.  However, when the array was
initialized it was given the type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>.  While
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">1.6</code> is a valid number, it is not a valid integer.  Therefore we
get an unfortunate exception at runtime.  Note that the above code will compile cleanly - you will only
notice the error when running the program.  At that point it could be too late!
</p>
<p>
Generics were designed (unlike arrays) to spot errors at compile time instead of runtime.  Therefore type
safety is ensured before even running a program.  The big difference between generics and arrays is that
generics implement erasure and are non-reifiable while arrays are reified.  Because of these differences
arrays and generics do not mix well, in fact if you try to mix them it will not work.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
/* You can't mix generics and arrays - the following are illegal */
List&lt;Number&gt;[] arr1 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()[10];
List&lt;?&gt;[] array = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;[10];
</CodeSnippet>
<Definition word="Reified">
The non computer science dictionary definition is something abstract that was made more concrete or real.  In
terms of programming languages a reified variable is one that knows its type at runtime.  At runtime, the type
is ‘real’.  In Java variables that are reified know their type and also enforce it at runtime.  This is why
Arrays enforce their type at runtime and don’t complain at compile time - they are reified.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Non-Reifiable">
The opposite of reified - something that is abstract which is not made concrete.  In a programming language
a non-reifiable variable is one that does not know or enforce its type at runtime (its type is abstract, not
concrete)<sup>2</sup>.  It only knows it’s type at compile time.  Therefore, it looses information about
itself when it is compiled.  Although we don’t know a generics type at runtime, we know that it is type safe
because it passed its compile time check.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Erasure">
The process of removing type constraints when code is compiled.  When a variable is implemented with erasure,
its type is checked at compile time and not at runtime<sup>3</sup>.  At runtime it does not know what type it
is.  This is how generics are implemented in Java.
</Definition>
<p>
The fact that generics are non-reifiable does have a nice side effect of only allowing type safe code to
compile.  It would be impossible to check the type safety of generics at runtime!  The sooner a developer
knows something is wrong with their code the better, so I am all for it.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Wildcards">Wildcards</SectionTitle>
<p>
When dealing with generic wildcards a lot of interesting behavior occurs.  There are two types of wildcards -
 unbounded and bounded.  Unbounded wildcards can be of any type, while bounded wildcards can be of any type
within the specified class hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
The problem with assigning generic instances to an unbounded wildcard type is that there is no way to know
what the type is at runtime (it could be an instance of any class!).  This uncertainty means a lot of
operations are not allowed since they are not type safe.  Luckily these occur at compile time.  Take an
example of unbounded wildcard lists:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;?&gt; uwList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;?&gt; uwList2 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();

/* Invalid operation */
uwList.add("hi");

/* Invalid operation */
uwList2.add(1);

List&lt;?&gt; uwList3 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(List.of("hi", "there"));

/* Invalid operation */
String hi = uwList3.get(0);

/* Valid operations */
var hi = uwList3.get(0);
Object there = uwList3.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the previous code both adding to the lists and assigning a list element to a type variable are
disallowed.  Adding to an unbounded typed list is illegal because there is no way of knowing if a value
of the correct type is added.  Similarly there is no guarantee that a declared variable type is equal to
the type of an unbounded generic list.  Therefore both these operations are disallowed.
</p>
<p>
You could however assign a list element to a variable of type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>
or use Java 10’s <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> keyword.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly unbounded wildcards are reified (unlike all other generics).  However this does not mean they
know their type at runtime.  The truth is unbounded wildcards never know their type (even at compile time), so
there is no type information to lose in the first place!<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
The interesting behavior also spills over into bounded wildcards:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n4 = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n5 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n6 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); // ERROR: Incompatible Types

List&lt;? extends Number&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(1,4,6));

/* Invalid operation */
numbers.add(1);

/* Valid operation */
Number number = numbers.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The syntax <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> defines a generic type
of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any subtype of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code>, such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>.  You can see in the code above
that using the subtype <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> for the assignment is valid but
using the supertype <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> is not.
</p>
<p>
The confusing part is what comes next.  When trying to add another integer to the array the operation will
fail.  This is because it is impossible to guarantee that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">numbers</code>
is actually an array of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code>, even though it was assigned
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> values.  If you think about it this makes sense.  The
list can be a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any subclass.  This means that is could
be an integer, but it also could be a double, float, or some other complex number type.  There is simply
no way of guaranteeing type safety, and once the code is compiled all type information will be lost.
</p>
<p>
However, you do know that the value returned from a list access call will be of type
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any of its subtypes.  Therefore it is valid to assign a
list element to type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>.
</p>
<p>
The other kind of unbounded wildcard can be any supertype:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n7 = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n8 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); // ERROR: Incompatible Types
List&lt;? super Number&gt; n8 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();

List&lt;? super Number&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(5, 6, 7));

/* Valid operation */
nums.add(8);

/* Invalid operation */
Number num = nums.get(1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here the opposite is true.  The syntax <code class="jarombek-inline-code">List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code>
defines a generic type of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or any supertype of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>, such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
You can see in the code above that using the supertype <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> for
the assignment is valid but using the subtype <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is not.
</p>
<p>
When adding to the list the operation succeeds.  That is because it is guaranteed that adding an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code> or
any of its supertypes (such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>).  This is thanks to
polymorphism - an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Integer</code> is a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code> and it also is an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
</p>
<p>
The reason why you cant read a value from the list and assign it to type <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Number</code> is you cant guarantee what types are in the list.  For example, if the list contained
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> values the assignment statement would be invalid - an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> is not a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Number</code>
<sup>5</sup>.

As you can see their are a lot of different complexities with generics and how they differ from arrays.
I never fully understood a lot of these quirks with generics, so I am happy I did a deep dive on the

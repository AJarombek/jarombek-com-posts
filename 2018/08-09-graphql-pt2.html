<p>
In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-5-2018-graphql-pt1">previous post on GraphQL</a>, I
gave a high level overview on the GraphQL ecosystem and how it compares to a traditional REST API.
Now it is time to discuss the language features of GraphQL and how it can be used to create an API
in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
There are two distinct pieces of GraphQL to remember.  First its a language to create queries for
an API.  Second its a runtime library on the server to handle queries directed at the API.  The
GraphQL language is what I will look at first.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The GraphQL Language">The GraphQL Language</SectionTitle>
<p>
The GraphQL language revolves around setting up an API schema (a model representation of the
methods the API exposes).  GraphQL also has syntax to query the API schema.
</p>
<p>
Let’s start by creating the API schema.  A GraphQL schema consists of different object types and
scalar types.  Object types represent an object that can have multiple fields<sup>1</sup>.
Scalar types represent concrete data of the schema<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Every GraphQL schema starts with one or two special root types - the mandatory
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code> type and the optional
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">mutation</code> type<sup>3</sup>.  Every query that you write
in GraphQL goes through the fields defined in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mutation</code> types.  These fields are the equivalents
of URL endpoints in a REST API model.
</p>
<p>
The following code defines the entry point to the API in the GraphQL language:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">schema</code> is an object type that holds two other object
types as fields.  Queries fetch data from the API (like a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GET
</code> request) and mutations manipulate data in the API (like <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
POST</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PUT</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">DELETE</code> requests).
</p>
<p>
In my application, I created an API
which handles exercise logging.  There are two different types of exercises that the API works
with - cardio exercises (such as running or biking) and strength exercises (such as core or weight
lifting).  Here is the API expressed in the GraphQL language:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
# Define all the root level queries for the GraphQL server
type Query {
  # Test query just to make sure that GraphQL is working
  test: String

  # Queries for the Exercise interface.  Note that certain fields existing on concrete
  # types implementing Exercise will not be accessible
  getAllExercises: [Exercise]
  getExercise(id: ID!): Exercise
  getExercises(name: String!): [Exercise]
  getExercisesByUser(user: String!): [Exercise]

  # Queries for cardio specific exercises (ex. runs, bike rides, swims, etc.)
  getAllCardioExercises: [Cardio]
  getCardioExercise(id: ID!): Cardio
  getCardioExercises(name: String!): [Cardio]
  getCardioExercisesByUser(user: String!): [Cardio]

  # Queries for strength specific exercises (ex. core, weight lifting)
  getAllStrengthExercises: [Strength]
  getStrengthExercise(id: ID!): Strength
  getStrengthExercises(name: String!): [Strength]
  getStrengthExercisesByUser(user: String!): [Strength]
}

# Define all the root level mutations for the GraphQL server
type Mutation {
  createCardioExercise(cardio: CardioInput!): Cardio
  createStrengthExercise(strength: StrengthInput!): Strength
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Types are defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> keyword.  Each type contains
fields, which can be passed a parameter.  For example, the field
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getExercises</code> takes in the parameter
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>
parameter is of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">String!</code>.  In GraphQL
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> is a built-in scalar type, which is easiest to
think of as a primitive type without any fields.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">!</code>
token means that the parameter can’t be null.  When queried, the field
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getExercises</code> returns an array of exercises, denoted as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">[Exercise]</code>.  Since there isn’t a non-null identifier on
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">[Exercise]</code>, it is possible no value gets returned.
Putting all these concepts together, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getExercises</code>
field on type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Query</code> is defined as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getExercises(name: String!): [Exercise]</code>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the API handles simple queries of existing data.  However, there are two fields defined as
mutations, both of which will create new exercise objects on the server.
</p>
<p>
If you read the comment above the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getAllExercises</code> field,
you may be wondering about these GraphQL interfaces.  Just like in any object oriented language,
interfaces in GraphQL define fields that must be used in concrete types that implement the
interface.  For my API model, I created an interface called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Exercise</code> that concrete types <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cardio</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Strength</code> implement.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
interface Exercise {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
}

type Cardio implements Exercise {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
  distance: Float
  minutes: Int
  seconds: Int
  type: CardioType!
}

type Strength implements Exercise {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
  workouts: [String]!
  type: StrengthType!
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Interfaces are defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">interface</code> keyword and
implementing types use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">implements</code> keyword.  While
many of the fields in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> are built-in scalar types
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">String</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Int</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Float</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ID</code>),
some of the types I defined myself.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CardioType</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">StrengthType</code> are enums, which represent a strict set of
values.  Enums are defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">enum</code> keyword.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
enum CardioType {
  RUN
  BIKE
  SWIM
  SKI
  HIKE
}

enum StrengthType {
  CORE
  LIFT
  OTHER
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Date</code> is a custom scalar type.  It is defined in GraphQL
as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">scalar Date</code>, however the logic for how to handle
custom scalars lives in the application code.  In my case that application code is JavaScript.  I
will look at the JavaScript code in just a bit.
</p>
<p>
One final group of types I created in GraphQL was inputs.  Input types allow complex objects
to be passed as arguments for a mutation.  For example, one of my mutation fields was
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createCardioExercise(cardio: CardioInput!): Cardio</code>, in
which <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CardioInput</code> is an input type.
Input types are defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">input</code> keyword.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
input ExerciseInput {
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
}

input CardioInput {
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
  distance: Float
  minutes: Int
  seconds: Int
  type: CardioType
}

input StrengthInput {
  name: String!
  user: String!
  description: String
  date: Date!
  workouts: [String]!
  type: StrengthType
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Unfortunately input types can’t implement interfaces, so there is a good bit of code duplication
here.  Maybe that is something GraphQL can address later in its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
Every code sample I just went over defined the API schema in the GraphQL language.  There are two
other pieces that need to be put in place before we have a functioning GraphQL API.  First is the
server API code, which in my case
is JavaScript running in a NodeJS environment.  JavaScript will connect the GraphQL schema
to actual data.  Finally I will query the GraphQL API using the GraphQL language.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="GraphQL.js">GraphQL.js</SectionTitle>
<p>
I set up a NodeJS environment to run an <a href="http://graphql.github.io/graphql-js/
running-an-express-graphql-server/">Express GraphQL</a> server.  <a href="https://expressjs.com/">
Express</a> is a web application framework built in JavaScript.  The npm packages
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql">express-graphql</a> and
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tools">graphql-tools</a> allow us to work with
GraphQL in an Express web application.
</p>
<p>
The main JavaScript file sets up a HTTP route for a web server.  When run locally the
following code starts a GraphQL API server at <strong>localhost:4000/</strong>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const express = require('express');
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql');

const GraphQLSchema = require('./graphQLSchema');
const GraphQLRoot = require('./graphQLRoot');

const app = express();
app.use('/', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: GraphQLSchema,
  rootValue: GraphQLRoot,
  graphiql: true
}));

const port = 4000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`GraphQL Server Running on Port ${port}`);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The method call <code className="jarombek-inline-code">app.use('/', graphqlHTTP({...}))</code> connects
GraphQL to the route <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/</code>.  In the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">graphqlHTTP()</code> method three things happen.
</p>
<p>
First, I define the GraphQL schema.  This code, which you can view in <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/08-Aug/8-5-graphql/graphQLSchema.js">
GraphQLSchema.js</a>, pulls in all the GraphQL language files that define the schema.  This includes
all the types such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cardio</code> along with all the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mutation
</code> entry points.  I also perform additional logic that can’t be handled by GraphQL alone.  This
includes defining custom scalar types (such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Date</code>) and
resolving concrete types from an interface reference (do calls to the interface
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code> return <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cardio
</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Strength</code>?).
</p>
<p>
Second I define a root object for the GraphQL schema.  Each field in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mutation
</code> types represents a function that returns or manipulates data.  While the field is declared in
GraphQL, its implementation must exist in the JavaScript code.  The query and mutation
implementation functions are placed in an object called root.  I created two JavaScript files - one
with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">root</code> object called
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/08-Aug/8-5-graphql/
graphQLRoot.js">graphQLRoot.js</a> and another with all the API data called
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/08-Aug/8-5-graphql/
exerciseData.js">exerciseData.js</a>.  I won’t show all the content of these files here as they are
quite long.  However, as an example here are the root JavaScript functions that correspond to the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getAllExercises</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getExercises</code> query fields in GraphQL:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const root = {

  /**
  * Get all the exercises in the data store
  * @return {*} an array of exercises
  */
  getAllExercises: () => data.exercises,

  /**
  * Get all the exercises with a given name.  Name is not a unique field.
  * @param arg - arguments passed through the getExercises() field.
  * @return all the exercises that match a name.
  */
  getExercises: (arg) => {
    return data.exercises.filter((exercise) => exercise.name === arg.name);
  }
}

const data = {
  exercises: [
    {
      id: uuid(),
      name: "Early Morning Beach Run",
      user: "Andy",
      description: "Morning run on the beach with a few strides",
      date: Date.parse("Aug 3, 2018"),
      distance: 3.12,
      minutes: 23,
      seconds: 46,
      type: "RUN"
    },
    {
      id: uuid(),
      name: "Track Workout at High School",
      user: "Andy",
      description: `Was drizzling during the warmup and raining for the workout.
      6x1000m at a much slower pace than in college (3:12-3:20)`,
      date: Date.parse("Aug 4, 2018"),
      distance: 8.75,
      type: "RUN"
    },
    {
      id: uuid(),
      name: "Push-Ups at Home",
      user: "Andy",
      description: "It was exhausting",
      date: Date.parse("Aug 4, 2018"),
      workouts: ["Push-Ups", "Sit-Ups"],
      type: "CORE"
    }
  ]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now I have the GraphQL schema set up along with functions corresponding to query and mutation
endpoints.  The final field in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">graphqlHTTP()</code> method
allows us to use GraphiQL, which is a debugging GUI for GraphQL in the browser.  It is almost like
having <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> inside your browser to test a GraphQL API.
GraphiQL is a really powerful tool to test GraphQL APIs.  I wish I had something similar for testing
REST endpoints!
</p>
<p>
This section was an extremely quick look at the JavaScript portion of the GraphQL API server, but I
encourage you to explore the full inline documented code on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/08-Aug/8-5-graphql">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Querying the GraphQL API">Querying the GraphQL API</SectionTitle>
<p>
Luckily, since I enabled the GraphiQL GUI debugger, all I have to do is run
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">node index.js</code> and open my browser to start testing the
GraphQL API.  GraphiQL has a really nice UI for writing queries and even has full documentation of
the queries and mutations defined by the API.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-8-18-graphiql.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Queries are written in the GraphQL language.  They are written with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code> keyword (although there is also a shorthand query
syntax where the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">query</code> keyword can be omitted).  If you
name your queries, GraphiQL will help by providing a dropdown to pick what query to execute.
</p>
<p>
The simplest query I made simply tests if GraphQL is running properly:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
query Test {
  test
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
GraphQLs response:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "data": {
    "test": "Hello From GraphQL!"
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Remember that GraphQL allows clients of the API to explicitly ask for the fields they want in the
response body.  The following query calls the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getExercisesByUser
</code> endpoint, asking only for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">description</code> fields.  There are other fields in the type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Exercise</code>, but we only want these two.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
query AndyExercises {
  getExercisesByUser(user: "Andy") {
    name
    description
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Response:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "data": {
    "getExercisesByUser": [
      {
        "name": "Early Morning Beach Run",
        "description": "Morning run on the beach with a few strides"
      },
      {
        "name": "Track Workout at High School",
        "description": "Was drizzling during the warmup and raining for the workout.  6x1000m at a much slower pace than in college (3:12-3:20)"
      },
      {
        "name": "Push-Ups at Home",
        "description": "It was exhausting"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Mutations are also easy to execute.  The following mutation creates a new running exercise.  After
it is created, I ask for all the newly created fields back from the API.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="GraphQL">
mutation AddNewRun {
  createCardioExercise(cardio: {
    name: "Beautiful Sunday Long Run"
    user: "Andy"
    date: "Aug 5, 2018"
    distance: 12.31
    type: RUN
  }) {
    id
    name
    user
    date
    distance
    type
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Response:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "data": {
    "createCardioExercise": {
      "id": "813423fe-5954-4137-93e4-fe5bf7a23c68",
      "name": "Beautiful Sunday Long Run",
      "user": "Andy",
      "date": "2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z",
      "distance": 12.31,
      "type": "RUN"
    }
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I created querys and mutations for all the defined endpoints, which you can check out in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/08-Aug/8-5-graphql/
queries.graphql">queries.graphql</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Wrapping Up">Wrapping Up</SectionTitle>
<p>
After working with GraphQL for the first time, I am really intrigued by this new way of creating
an API.  Sometime in the future I will create a full GraphQL API prototype with a front-end and
database.  At that point I can make a conclusion about GraphQLs use in a production application.
Maybe someday GraphQL will even replace the REST APIs I enjoy working with so much!

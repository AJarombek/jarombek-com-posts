When developers think of the JavaScript engines execution of code in the browser, thoughts of a
single threaded event loop come to mind.  You often hear people say that JavaScript does not
support multithreaded programming and that only one piece of code can run at a time.  What they
are referring to is the event loop, which delegates browser events for execution one at a time.
But is JavaScript really single threaded?  The answer to that question used to be "it is hard to
tell" unless you had access to how exactly different browsers were executing the JavaScript code.
Now with the Web Workers API the answer is without a doubt "no".
</p>
<p>
Web Workers allow multithreaded JavaScript programming in the browser.  This discovery post will
discuss the basics of what Web Workers are and give some sample code of their basic functionality.
</p>
<h5>How the Browser Executes JavaScript</h5>
<p>
JavaScript code in the browser is executed in two different phases.  The first phase occurs when a
webpage is first loaded.  At this phase the DOM is built from the HTML template and all the
associated JavaScript code either inlined or in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
&lt;script&gt;</code> tags is executed<sup>1</sup>.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
&lt;script&gt;</code> tags are executed sequentially unless specified with the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> or <code class="jarombek-inline-code">defer</code>
attributes<sup>2</sup>.  My guess is this JavaScript code is executed in a single thread since order
must not be violated, although it is hard to say without seeing how the browsers work behind the
scenes.  Either way, from the programmers view <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
&lt;script&gt;</code> tags are executed synchronously.
</p>
<p>
At this stage all event handlers are set up.  These event handlers use the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">addEventListener()</code> function from the DOM API to respond
to DOM events<sup>3</sup>.  This is where JavaScripts asynchronous nature comes into play - you
never know when an event such as a mouse click or scroll will occur.  Responding to these events
is what the second execution phase is for.
</p>
<p>
The second JavaScript execution phase is all about responding to asynchronous events.  Every event
that occurs in the browser can be assigned one or many
event handler functions<sup>4</sup>. Event handler functions are implemented with
JavaScript and the DOM API.  Whenever an event occurs in the browser the event handler function is
invoked.  The event is added to a FIFO event queue which JavaScript will handle one at a time.
This is where the single threaded loop idea comes into play - JavaScript will only dispatch one
event handler to be executed at a time.
</p>
<p>
I have read conflicting articles about whether or not JavaScript has multithreading when handling
the event loop.  Some articles say that the JavaScript code that handles events is actually in
multiple threads<sup>5</sup>.  Once again, even if there is some multithreaded JavaScript happening
behind the scenes it is abstracted away from the developers view.  Everything must still pass
through the single threaded event loop.
</p>
<h5>Introducing Web Workers</h5>
<p>
So why are Web Workers a big deal?  Web Workers allow us to dispatch messages to a separate
JavaScript thread for execution.  This means that the Web Worker isn't on the main thread and
won't clog up the event queue.  Imagine you had a very long expensive computation occurring on
the main thread. In this case most of the event queue would be filled with the resource
intensive operation instead of focusing on responding to browser events.  This would make
performance sluggish.  Imagine if it took a long time for the browser to respond to a button
click or if animations on the webpage were lagging?  End users would not be happy.
</p>
<p>
When using Web Workers you no longer have to worry about an operation using too much of the
event queues capacity.  The Web Worker functions in an entirely separate thread.  The code for
a web worker is in a separate file from the main threads JavaScript code.  In order to use the
Web Worker, a new <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Worker</code> instance is created and the
main thread passes messages to the worker thread.
</p>
<p>
Web Workers wait for messages to come from the main thread and handle them once they arrive.
The worker code performs some logic of its own and then passes a message back to the client.
</p>
<h5>Web Worker Implementation</h5>
<p>
To make these concepts more concrete let's look at an example of a simple Web Worker.  The goal
of this Web Worker is to add a timestamp to the message it receives (in my implementation the
message represents a note).
</p>
<p>
First I defined some JavaScript code in the main thread:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const noteInput = document.getElementById('noteInput');
const outputDiv = document.querySelector('.output');

if (window.Worker) {

  const noteWorker = new Worker("worker.js");

  ...

} else {
  console.error("Web Worker Not Supported!");
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The first thing I do in this code is access two DOM elements - the note input and the output.
The input is where a user will enter a new note and the output will display the note with a
timestamp.
</p>
<p>
Next the code checks if the global <code class="jarombek-inline-code">window</code> object has
a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Worker</code> property.  If this property exists, the
current browser supports Web Workers.  Almost all major browsers
<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers">support Web Workers</a> these days, so unless
the user is using an old browser this check should pass.
</p>
<p>
Inside the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">window</code> object check, I first created a web
worker by invoking the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Worker(path)</code> constructor function.
The path parameter is passed a URL argument with the location of the worker code<sup>6</sup>.
In this case I am just using the local <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/06-Jun/6-13-Web-Workers/worker.js">worker.js</a> file.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the code adds an event listener to the note input field and another event listener for
the Web Worker.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
  ...

  const noteWorker = new Worker("worker.js");

  noteInput.addEventListener("keyup", (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Check if the enter button was pressed
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      const newNote = noteInput.value;
      noteInput.value = "";

      // If so pass the input elements value to the web worker for processing
      noteWorker.postMessage({note: newNote});
    }
  });

  noteWorker.onmessage = (e) => {

    // When a message is received from the web worker a new HTML element will be
    // created displaying the workers message
    const newNote = document.createElement("div");
    const noteContent = document.createTextNode(e.data.note);
    newNote.appendChild(noteContent);
    outputDiv.prepend(newNote);
  }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Learning the DOM API is beyond the scope of this post, but basically the first listener waits
for <code class="jarombek-inline-code">"keyup"</code> events on the input field.  Whenever a key
press is released, the event is added to the event loop queue and the event handler function
(defined in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">addEventListener()</code> function) is
triggered.
</p>
<p>
The event handler function is implemented to check if the key pressed has the code
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">13</code>, which corresponds to the enter key.  If the enter
key is pressed, I get the input value (and clear its value from the DOM).  The input value is
then sent as a message body to the Web Worker.  Messages are sent to the worker via the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">postMessage()</code> method on the Web Worker object.
</p>
<p>
The second event listener waits for messages back from the Web Worker.  This listener can be
implemented as a function on the Web Worker objects <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
onmessage</code> property.  My implementation takes the message contents and adds them into the
output portion of the webpage.
</p>
<p>
The other file of JavaScript code defines the Web Worker.  This code is very straightforward.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
onmessage = (e) => {

  // Add a timestamp to the note and pass it back to the main thread
  const date = new Date();
  const result = {note: `${e.data.note} - ${date.toString()}`};

  postMessage(result);
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All the Web Worker does is listen for the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">onmessage</code>
event and then respond to it.  Before responding, my worker adds a timestamp to the data sent in
the message.  The response itself is handled in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
postMessage(data)</code> function, which is defined in the global scope of the web worker.  A
web workers global scope is the worker itself, which is why <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
postMessage()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">onmessage</code> are not called on an
object variable directly<sup>7</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Just a quick reminder before moving forward, this would be an awful use case of a Web Worker!
Workers are supposed to be used for extremely expensive tasks that clog the main threads
event queue.  This implementation just demonstrates how they work in an educational sense.
</p>
<h5>Running the Web Workers</h5>
<p>
Along with the JavaScript code previously discussed, to get my Web Workers functioning I also
created a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/06-Jun/
6-13-Web-Workers/index.html">HTML file</a> for the view and a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/06-Jun/6-13-Web-Workers/index.css">CSS file</a>
for the styling.
</p>
<p>
In order to get Web Workers to running a web server must be deployed.  An easy way to start a
web server locally is to use the npm module "serve."  Deploying a server with the serve module
only takes one command<sup>8</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Globally install the serve dependency which serves up a static web server.
yarn global add serve

# Spin up local web server
serve
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Once the server is deployed, you can watch the Web Workers in action:
</p>
<figure>
<img class="jarombek-blog-image" src="./assets/posts/6-13-18-writing-notes.gif"/>
</figure>
<p>
If you look at the network sources in chrome, you will see a few files in the main thread and the
worker file in the Web Worker thread.
</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>
<p>
I am really interested in learning more about Web Workers.  I haven't found a use case for them
yet in my personal projects, but it is good to know they are available if the need arises.
</p>
<p>
The Web Worker shown in this discovery was a dedicated worker - one that can only be accessed by
the script that called it.  There is another type of worker that I would like to explore in the
future called a shared worker.  This type of worker can be shared globally among all scripts in a
domain<sup>9</sup>.  Maybe I will look into shared workers in a future post.
</p>
<p>
As always, the code for this discovery is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/06-Jun/6-13-Web-Workers">GitHub</a>.

Since mid March a lot of my free time work has been dedicated to building React.js apps.  In fact, I built
this website in the past month and a half with the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.
Before I started building this website I built a sample prototype application using two key technologies -
React and Webpack.  The knowledge I learned from this prototype helped jump start my work on the website.
This discovery looks at the first technology used in the prototype application - React.  I will
look at the Webpack portion of the prototype in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-4-2018-webpack-seed">next discovery post</a>.

React is a library for generating views.  A view is the UI of an application, and for a web application
it is rendered HTML.  In a traditional web application, the client side JavaScript code manipulates the HTML view
through the Document Object Model (DOM) API.  When using React on the client side,
views are interacted with through a construct called the "Virtual DOM."
</p>
<Definition word="Virtual DOM">
The Virtual DOM is a layer of abstraction used over the Document Object Model (DOM) in React.  The Virtual DOM is
kept in memory and is altered using the React library.  A React developer never interacts with
the DOM API itself.  They only communicate with the Virtual DOM to change the UI.  Behind the scenes,
React makes sure the Virtual DOM's virtual representation of the UI matches the state of the DOM<sup>1</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
The biggest difference between the Virtual DOM and the DOM is that the Virtual DOM implements a declarative API
while the DOM's API is imperative.  In other words, one programmer tells the DOM API how the view needs to
change while another programmer tells the Virtual DOM what needs to change about the view.  Imperative is
how something needs to be done to accomplish a task.  Declarative is what task should be accomplished.
</p>
<p>
A more in depth analysis of imperative and declarative paradigms is beyond the scope of this discovery post,
but in the context of the Virtual DOM a
developer doesn't need to know how the DOM API works in order to update views.  All a React developer
needs to tell the Virtual DOM is what they want the view to be.  React is declarative - it asks the developer for
what needs to be accomplished and internally it takes care of how its done.
</p>
<p>
Reacts declarative approach makes it easy and quick to create views without the learning curve of the DOM API.
However, the Virtual DOM does have some drawbacks.  First off its memory intensive since the UI
is kept in memory throughout the applications lifecycle<sup>2</sup>.  With the DOM API you do not have
this additional overhead.  Also you don't have the expressiveness and speed of the DOM API with the Virtual DOM
(A major misconception is that React is faster than the traditional DOM - this is false<sup>3,4</sup>).  With
the DOM API you know based on your code exactly how the DOM will respond, while with React you have to hope the
Virtual DOM makes the correct choice for you.
</p>
<p>
Despite the drawbacks using a declarative approach makes creating views a breeze for JavaScript developers.
  React allows developers to think of view elements as a simple construct - the JavaScript object!  Views in React
are made up of many building blocks called React Elements.
</p>
<Definition word="React Element">
A JavaScript object that represents the smallest building block of the UI.  In a web environment a React element
represents an HTML element (also referred to as a DOM node).  It can also represent a React component.
While a React element can be created directly as a JavaScript object with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code>, doing this for an entire UI is very
verbose.  Often React elements are created in JSX, which uses an HTML style syntax.
</Definition>
<Definition word="React Component">
Components in React are a form of encapsulation over React elements.  Components promote code reuse, containing a
piece of the UI that can be used multiple times throughout an application.  Components also have lifecycles
and can contain <code className="jarombek-inline-code">props</code> (values passed to the component from other
components) and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code> (data specific to the component instance).
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">props</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code> are what
allow components to be dynamic, living entities.
</Definition>
<Definition word="JSX">
JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language created by Facebook for React.  It follows HTML-like syntax to
create hierarchies of React elements.  For example, a React element in JavaScript is created like so:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement("p", null, "Hi There!")</code>.  The same element is
created in JSX with the following syntax: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;p&gt;Hi There!&lt;/p&gt;</code>
</Definition>
<p>
With these concepts in mind, let's go over the React seed project I built!  Here is what the final product looks like:

<SectionTitle title="Building the Application">Building the Application</SectionTitle>
<p>
The first step of a React application is to build an HTML template for React.js to latch onto.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;React.js Webpack Seed&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="react-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This HTML document contains a body with a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">div</code> element.  React will
begin rendering further HTML elements dynamically inside this element.
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering where the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is for the JavaScript.  Webpack
actually handles bundling the JavaScript and including it in the HTML document, so we don't have to worry about
it!  I will discuss the Webpack aspects of this project in my next discovery post.
</p>
<p>
To hook up React with this HTML element the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> function is called.
The following code sample sets up the entire React application.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

window.React = React;

render(
    &lt;App /&gt;,
    document.getElementById('react-container')
);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> function takes two parameters.  The first is the React
element that will be rendered - which in this case is a React component I created called
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">App</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">App</code> component holds
the UI and state for the entire application.
</p>
<p>
The second parameter is the container in which the React element is rendered.  This is the only DOM API call
made in the application.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">document.getElementById('react-container')
</code> finds the HTML element with the given id in the previously shown HTML file.
</p>
<p>
Once the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> function is called, the React application is successfully
initialized.  It is time to build the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">App</code> component.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="App Component"><code className="jarombek-header-code">App</code> Component</SectionTitle>
<p>
There are a couple of different ways to build a component in React.  For the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">App
</code> component I used a class based approach.  Later you will see the other two components in the application using a
functional approach.
</p>
<p>
Why did I choose the class based approach over the functional one?  A class based component has access to lifecycle
methods and component state.  On the other hand a functional component is stateless and only has one function -
therefore there is no way to redefine the lifecycle methods.
</p>
<p>
Since the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">App</code> component needs to hold the state of my entire application, I
need to use a class based component.   A class based component extends the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
React.Component</code> class using ES6 class syntax.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
class App extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            technologies: [
            {
                id: "375e6c2b-d799-47ef-848d-84b42bef7a29",
                name: "JavaScript",
                picture: "./assets/js.png",
                release_date: moment('1995-12-04')
            },
            {
                id: "75bb50f5-9067-4a30-964f-a3f0d42b5ca4",
                name: "Webpack",
                picture: "./assets/webpack.png",
                release_date: moment('2012-03-10')
            },
            {
                id: "ed13c757-27cd-4cc1-b4ac-de449ee9cbae",
                name: "React",
                picture: "./assets/react.png",
                release_date: moment('2013-03-01')
            },
            {
                id: "d9f08c13-f59f-45bb-b8e9-0bd0114b0adf",
                name: "Sass",
                picture: "./assets/sass.png",
                release_date: moment('2006-11-28')
            }
            ]
        }
    }

    render() {
        const {technologies} = this.state;
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;div className="title-container"&gt;
                    &lt;p className="title"&gt;React Webpack Seed&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;p className="sub-title"&gt;Technologies used&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;TechnologyList techList={technologies} /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The application displays a list of different technologies.  In the code above
these technologies are assigned to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">this.state</code>.  This variable
holds the state for the component.
</p>
<p>
Another major piece of this component is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> function.  The
return value of this function is what is rendered in the HTML.  The returned value is a hierarchy of React
Elements in the form of JSX.  I also deconstructed the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">technologies</code> array
from the state and passed it as a prop to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TechnologyList</code> component.
Remember that props are simply values passed from one component to another.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">TechnologyList</code> component orchestrates the UI display for all the
technologies.  Let's look at that now.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="TechnologyList Component"><code className="jarombek-header-code">TechnologyList</code> Component</SectionTitle>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import Technology from './Technology';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const TechnologyList = ({ techList=[] }) =&gt;
    &lt;div className="technology-list"&gt;
        { (techList.length === 0) ?
            &lt;p&gt;No Data&lt;/p&gt; :
            techList.map(technology =&gt;
                &lt;Technology key={technology.id} {...technology} /&gt;
            )
        }
    &lt;/div&gt;;
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
TechnologyList.propTypes = {
    techList: PropTypes.array
};

export default TechnologyList;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Unlike the main application component which holds state, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TechnologyList</code>
is a stateless functional component.  Keeping only one component stateful makes an application easier to manage
since no child components will cause unexpected changes to the application state.
</p>
<p>
An easy way to reason about stateless functional components is that the entire function is a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> function.  Whatever the function returns will be rendered to HTML.
</p>
<p>
The functional component takes one parameter - the props passed to the component.  I destructured the props in the
function parameter definition itself.  The syntax <code className="jarombek-inline-code">techList=[]</code>
defines a prop called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">techList</code> with an empty array default value.
</p>
<p>
In the JSX for this component I incorporated some JavaScript code to check if the technology list is populated.
Depending on whether or not its populated, different React elements are rendered.  If there are objects in the
list, a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Technology</code> component is rendered for each one.  This shows
the dynamic nature of React and JSX - depending on the state and props passed into a component different UIs
are displayed.
</p>
<p>
Finally I defined the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">propTypes</code> variable on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">TechnologyList</code> component.  This is used for property validation.  If a
prop type is passed in to the component that doesn't match the type defined in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
propTypes</code>, a warning is issued.  This is extremely helpful for catching bugs early and unit testing<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Technology Component"><code className="jarombek-header-code">Technology</code> Component</SectionTitle>
<p>
The last component displays information about the technology.  It is a functional stateless component.  You can
use all the concepts I went over in this discovery post to understand what is happening here.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import moment from 'moment';

const Technology = ({ name, release_date, picture }) =&gt;
    &lt;div className="technology"&gt;
        &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img src={ require(`${picture}`) } /&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p className="tech-name"&gt;{name}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p className="tech-release-date"&gt;
            {moment(release_date).format('MMMM Do, YYYY')}
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;;

Technology.propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    release_date: PropTypes.instanceOf(Date).isRequired,
    picture: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default Technology;

That is all the JavaScript React code needed to create the UI for my seed project.  I have enjoyed working in React
so far.  Using functional techniques and pure JavaScript to create modular front-end code definitely makes React
stand out.  I am still early on in the React discovery process, but considering I have a website in production
written with the library I will continue to learn!
</p>
<p>
You can find all the code along with Sass styling & Jest unit testing on 
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-webpack-seed">Github</a>.  Next time I will go over the
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-4-2018-webpack-seed">Webpack</a> portion of the project!

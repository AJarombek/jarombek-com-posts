Recently I looked at RabbitMQ, a message broker used to communicate between different parts of
an application.  An analogy I really liked is that RabbitMQ puts a post office in an application, where producers
put messages in a post office box, which are then routed to consumers<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
RabbitMQ configuration can be written in any language with a RabbitMQ library (which consists
of most languages you know).  This is extremely powerful since different pieces of the
RabbitMQ channel can be implemented in different languages.  For example, let's say a
RabbitMQ server has one producer and three consumers.  The single producer might be written in Java,
while the three consumers might be written in JavaScript, Python, and PHP.  Imagine all the different possibilities
of sending RabbitMQ messages across applications!
</p>
<p>
In order to get to know RabbitMQ better, I made an enhanced 'hello world' example where producers
send JSON representing running logs to different consumers.  All the code is in Python, since the RabbitMQ
Python API is very short and sweet!  Let's take a look!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Producer">Producer</SectionTitle>
<p>
My producer starts by taking command line arguments and converting them to JSON.  This JSON is used for the
message bodies sent across the RabbitMQ channel.  The producer also takes arguments to help create routing
keys, which are like mailing addresses.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# The ArgumentParser API is used for specifying command line arguments
# description - a text description shown when you use the --help argument
parser = ArgumentParser(description='Upload a New Log')

# const - the string that will be placed in the dest array if the argument is used

json_data = json.dumps(json_object)

<p>
Now I need to generate a routing key for this message.  Routing keys in RabbitMQ are strings
separated by <code class="jarombek-inline-code">.</code> symbols.  For example, a key could be written as
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foo.bar</code>.  These keys are used in the topic exchange type, where
each consumer specifies a routing key pattern to subscribe to<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def build_routing_key(key_list):
    """ Build up the routing key from a list of routes """

    str = ""

    for i in range(len(key_list)):
        if i != 0:
            str += "."

        str += key_list[i]

    return str

routing_key = build_routing_key(args.routing_keys)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now I need to create a connection to RabbitMQ.  First I created two new
RabbitMQ users on the command line, one for consuming and one for producing.  The following example creates the users and gives them both full
permissions to configure, read, and write to RabbitMQ across all queues and exchanges.  The
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">".*"</code> pattern is what matches to any queue or exchange, with the
first pattern for configuring, the second for reading, and the last for writing<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Add a new RabbitMQ user to consume messages
rabbitmqctl add_user running-log-consumer iconsume

# Add a new RabbitMQ user to produce messages
rabbitmqctl add_user running-log-producer iproduce

rabbitmqctl set_permissions running-log-consumer ".*" ".*" ".*"
rabbitmqctl set_permissions running-log-producer ".*" ".*" ".*"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Since I'm building the producer, I'll use the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
running-log-producer</code> user.  A connection to RabbitMQ is done over
TCP (a reliable data stream protocol between applications).  Inside each RabbitMQ TCP connection
is a channel, which is a virtual connection to perform messaging commands<sup>4</sup>.  The following
code sets up this channel:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(cred.USERNAME, cred.PASSWORD)
connection_params = pika.ConnectionParameters(cred.SERVER, virtual_host=cred.VHOST,
                                                credentials=credentials)

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(connection_params)
channel = connection.channel()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now comes the largest piece of the producer: the exchange.  In fact, all the producer really does
is publish messages on the exchange and RabbitMQ handles the rest.  Eventually, exchanges hand
off messages to queues based on specified routing keys<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The following code creates an exchange and publishes a message to it with the JSON I created earlier.
The full code for the producer is up on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/
2018/01-Jan/1-24-RabbitMQ/producer.py">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Declare the running-log exchange
# exchange -- the name of the exchange
# exchange_type -- the type of exchange, in this case a topic exchange
# passive -- perform an exchange declare (False) or just check if it exists (True)
# durable -- If the exchange will survive a RabbitMQ reboot
# auto_delete -- If the exchange will be removed when no queues are bound to it
channel.exchange_declare(exchange=cred.EXCHANGE, exchange_type='topic', passive=False,
                            durable=True, auto_delete=False)

# Publish to the channel and check for publisher confirms
# exchange -- the exchange to publish to
# routing_key -- the routing key to bind to
# properties -- basic properties of the message
# body -- the message contents
if channel.basic_publish(exchange=cred.EXCHANGE, routing_key=routing_key, properties=msg_props,
                            body=json_data):
    print("Confirm Received!")
else:
    print("Message Lost!")
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Consumer">Consumer</SectionTitle>
<p>
Now its time to build the RabbitMQ consumer.  Similar to the producer, I started by creating a
connection and defining an exchange.  I then created a queue on the exchange and determined all the routing
keys that the queue accepts.  The python code takes routing keys
as command line arguments.  If there is no command line argument, the queue accepts all routing keys.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Declare a queue and create it if needed
# queue --  the name of the queue - if you dont specify a name RabbitMQ will auto create one
# exclusive -- only allow access by the current connection
# durable -- Survives a reboot
result = channel.queue_declare(queue='log', exclusive=True, durable=True)
queue_name = result.method.queue

# Use command line arguments to get the binding keys
binding_keys = sys.argv[1:]
if not binding_keys:
    # Bind a queue to an exchange and match to all routing keys ('#' operator)
    channel.queue_bind(exchange=cred.EXCHANGE, queue=queue_name, routing_key='#')
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now that the queues are set up, I created a consumer to read messages.  The following
Python code sets up a consumer and tells it to listen to certain queues.  The consumer uses a callback
function which is invoked when messages are received.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def consumer(ch, method, properties, body):
    """ Consumer callback is called when a message is consumed """
    if body == 'quit':

        # Cancel a consumer
        # consumer_tag -- id for the consumer
        ch.basic_cancel(consumer_tag='consumer')
        ch.stop_consuming()
    else:
        print(" [x] %r:%r" % (method.routing_key, body))
    return

# Start a queue consumer and bind messages to the callback function
# queue -- the name of the queue to consume from
# consumer_tag -- the id of the consumer
# no_ack -- tell the broker not to expect a response back
channel.basic_consume(consumer, queue=queue_name, consumer_tag='consumer', no_ack=True)
channel.start_consuming()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you want to run the producers and consumers to see messaging in action, the commands are on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/01-Jan/1-24-RabbitMQ/setup.sh">GitHub</a>.

While I wrote my RabbitMQ code in Python, it can be written in many different languages! This code shows the small amount
of configuration needed to set up messaging.  RabbitMQ is simply a data transfer mechanism, the real power of
an application is the code around it!

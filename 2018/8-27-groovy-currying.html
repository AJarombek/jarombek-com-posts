Something I'm really interested in is incorporating functional programming practices into my
code.  Despite not working in any purely functional languages (although I am starting to look
at Haskell), most imperative and object oriented languages support certain functional 
operations.  In my recent exploration of Groovy, I noticed that closures support the
currying technique.  Currying in Groovy takes an existing function and creates a new specialized
variant.  This post explains how to use currying to enhance Groovy closures.
</p>
<h5>What is Currying?</h5>
<p>
My exploration of Groovy wasn't the first time I crossed paths with currying.  Currying was
mentioned in my readings on Java 8 along with my brief research so far of Haskell (a functional
programming language).  Currying is named after Haskell Curry, an American mathematician (the
Haskell language is also named after Curry)<sup>1,2</sup>.  The goal of currying in Groovy is to
make specialized versions of a function.  To accomplish this, pieces of a function are
put into a fixed state prior to invocation.
</p>
<p>
Confusingly, Groovy's definition of currying does not match the purely functional definition of
currying.  Currying in Groovy aligns closer to the definition of a partial application.
</p>
<Definition word="Currying">
Curried functions are those that take in their arguments one at a time instead of all at
once<sup>3</sup>.  A function takes in arguments one at a time by having a single argument and
returning a function that also takes a single argument<sup>4</sup>.  Returning a function makes a
curried function a higher order function - one that either takes in a function as an argument or
results in a function.  A basic example of a curried function is one that multiplies two numbers.
Denoted as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">mult :: Int -> (Int -> Int)</code>, this curried
function is invoked with the statement <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
mult 2 3</code>, resulting in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">6</code> (note the syntax matches
Haskell). <code class="jarombek-inline-code">mult</code> takes a single integer argument and 
returns a function that also takes a single integer argument.  Curried functions are commonly used 
to create partial applications.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Partial Application">
A partial application is when some of a curried function's arguments are supplied a fixed value
before invocation.  The resulting function is a specialized version of the curried function.
</Definition>
<h5>Haskell Currying and Partial Applications</h5>
<p>
In Haskell, a curried function that multiplies two numbers is straightforward.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
mult :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
mult x y = x * y
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
> mult 2 3
6
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now that a curried function exists, partial implementations are easily defined.  Note that the
following partial implementations fix one of the curried functions arguments to a value.  For example,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">dub</code> fixes one of the integer arguments to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">2</code>, so all function invocations will multiply the functions
argument by 2.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
-- A partial implementation of the 'mult' function that doubles a number
dub :: Int -> Int
dub = mult 2

-- Another partial implementation of the 'mult' function that multiplies a number by 10
x10 :: Int -> Int
x10 = mult 10
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
dub 3
> 6

x10 3
> 30
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Haskell isn't the focus of the remaining article, so no more code from the language is shown.
However, I think it's important to see different ways a functional language handles currying.  Keeping the
purely functional approach in the back of our minds will assist in understanding Groovy's approach.
</p>
<h5>Currying Groovy Closures</h5>
<p>
The closure object in Groovy has a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">curry()</code> method.
Invoking <code class="jarombek-inline-code">curry()</code> creates a partial implementation of the
closure.  It is important to remember that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">curry()</code> does
not create a curried function like those we defined in Haskell.  Currying
in Groovy only creates specialized versions of a function (yes, this is confusing.  You may want to
re-read this paragraph).
</p>
<p>
The basic example of partial implementations in Groovy match the multiplication methods we defined
in Haskell:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
def times = { x, y -> x * y }

assert times(2, 2) == 4

def timesTwo = times.curry(2)

assert timesTwo(5) == 10

def timesTen = times.curry(10)

assert timesTen(10) == 100
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The argument passed to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">curry()</code> method is a value
bound to one of the closures parameters.
</p>
<p>
One solid use case of partial implementation is to take a generic function and create many
specialized variants.  In the following code I have a generic closure for logging exercises.  The
parameters of the closure <code class="jarombek-inline-code">workout</code> are the distance,
time spent, and type of exercise.  Specialized workout closures are built with partial
implementations:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
// Closure that prints out a workout
def workout = { type, miles, minutes, seconds ->

  def min = minutes >= 10 ? minutes : "0$minutes"
  def sec = seconds >= 10 ? seconds : "0$seconds"

  return "$type $miles miles in $min:$sec"
}

assert workout("Ran", 4.7, 32, 5) == "Ran 4.7 miles in 32:05"

// Bind the 'type' argument to the value 'Ran'.  All exercises that use the new curried closure are runs
def run = workout.curry("Ran")

assert run(4.58, 29, 18) == "Ran 4.58 miles in 29:18"

// Bind the 'type' argument to the value 'Ran' and the 'miles' argument to the 5K mile conversion
def run5K = workout.curry("Ran", 3.106)

assert run5K(15, 27) == "Ran 3.106 miles in 15:27"

// Bind the second argument in the workout closure to the 5K mile conversion
def fiveK = workout.ncurry(1, 3.106)

assert fiveK("Biked", 15, 0) == "Biked 3.106 miles in 15:00"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Partial implementations get really interesting when closure parameters are also closures.  One
example is a composition closure, which combines two other closures<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
def composition = { f, g, x -> f(g(x)) }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Compositions are used in advanced examples of partial implementations.  The following code snippet
gives a taste of how to utilize compositions and partial implementations together.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
/**
* Represents a running pace/time in minutes and seconds
*/
class Time {
  int minutes
  int seconds

  /**
  * Calculate the mile pace for a run given a distance in miles and the time spent running
  * @param miles - the mileage of the run
  * @param time - the time it took to complete the run
  * @return the pace of the run
  */
  static int milePace(double miles, Time time) {
    def seconds = (time.minutes * 60) + time.seconds
    return seconds / miles
  }

  @Override
  String toString() {
    return "Time: $minutes:${seconds >= 10 ? seconds : "0${seconds}"}"
  }
}

// Closure to convert an integer representing seconds into a Time object
def toPace = {int seconds -> new Time(minutes: Math.floor(seconds / 60), seconds: seconds % 60)}

// Use the milePace() static method as a closure.  This gives us access to the curry() method
def pace = Time.&milePace

// Curry the pace closure to calculate paces for 5K races
def pacePer5K = pace.curry(3.106)

// The purpose of a composition closure is to combine two other closures
def composition = { f, g, x -> f(g(x)) }

// Create a composition of the pacePer5K closure and the toPace closure.  The resulting closure takes in a
// 5K time and returns the pace of the 5K represented by a Time object.
def minutesPerMileFor5K = composition.curry(toPace, pacePer5K)

def pr = [minutes: 15, seconds: 27] as Time

assert minutesPerMileFor5K(pr).toString() == "Time: 4:58"

def trackTT = [minutes: 16, seconds: 42] as Time

assert minutesPerMileFor5K(trackTT).toString() == "Time: 5:22"
</CodeSnippet>
<h5>Conclusions</h5>
<p>
I'm still unsure about specific use cases for currying and partial implementations outside of
a purely functional language like Haskell.  However, like any programming concept it is another
skill added to the resume.  I'll keep you updated if I use currying or partial implementations in
any of my production applications.

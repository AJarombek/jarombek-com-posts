This is part II of my Oracle advanced query discovery.  You can check out
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-18-2018-oracle-adv-pt1">part I</a> as well!  The two clauses
I'm analyzing in this discovery are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code>.  The table I'm running queries against is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">code_written</code>,
which stores how many lines of code I wrote in each language over the years.
The data is real too!
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause allows you to access columns in
a multidimensional array.  The calculations performed on
this array are similar to those seen in a spreadsheet application<sup>1</sup>.
The reason Oracle included the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause is
users often copied SQL query results and pasted them into spreadsheets, manipulating
the data from there.  With <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code>, similar manipulations are performed in native SQL.
</p>
<p>
The following query is a basic example of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code>
clause.  I don't think my lines written statistics are an accurate representation of time spent
in each language.  For example, Java is a very verbose language.
Meanwhile, Python has very concise syntax and I often make complex programs
in very little code.  I used the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause
to adjust the lines written for Java and Python based on their verbosity.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT year, language, lines_written
  FROM code_written
MODEL
PARTITION BY (year)
DIMENSION BY (language)
MEASURES (lines lines_written) (
    lines_written['Java'] = ROUND(lines_written['Java'] * 0.8),
    lines_written['Python'] = ROUND(lines_written['Python'] * 1.25)
)
ORDER BY lines_written DESC NULLS LAST;
</CodeSnippet>
<span className="code-span">

----- ------------- ---------------
2017  Swift         10726
2016  Java          10370
2017  Java          9690

....  ...           ....
</span>
<p>
In the results, Swift is now listed as the language with the most lines written in 2017.
</p>
<p>
Besides for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause, the three other important
clauses in this query are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PARTITION BY</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">DIMENSION BY</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MEASURES</code>.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PARTITION BY</code> defines groupings in a result set.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> performs operations on each of these
groupings<sup>2</sup>.  In my query I partition by year, so rules defined later are applied to each year.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">DIMENSION BY</code> identifies each cell in the partition.
Each cell makes up one element in a multidimensional array.  In the query above,
I dimension by language so each cell is a language.  I selected a cell
with the strings <code className="jarombek-inline-code">'Java'</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">'Python'</code>.  The array created from the partition in the query above only has
one dimension, but that doesn't have to be the case.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">MEASURES</code> defines what type is located in each cell along with
the name of the array<sup>3</sup>.  In the previous query, I
declared that each cell contains a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lines</code> element and the
array is named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lines_written</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another cool thing about the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">MODEL</code> clause is
its possible to loop through the array of cells with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">FOR</code>
loop<sup>4</sup>.  You can get the current value within the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">FOR</code>
loop with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CURRENTV()</code>.  The
following queries get the monthly line totals for each language.  Although the queries all return the same
result, you can follow the comments to see how each optimizes the previous query.

Now onto probably the coolest thing I've seen in Oracle so far: the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code> clause!  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code> is used to rotate
rows into columns!  An aggregate function must be used with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code> clause.  The following query rotates the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">year</code> row into multiple columns:

<CodeSnippet language="SQL">

    year,
    language,

Now that is awesome!  This is the exact layout I'd use for this data in an Excel
spreadsheet.  I can improve this query by displaying the total
number of lines for each language using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GROUP BY ROLLUP</code>
clause and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">GROUPING()</code>.

Notice that I created a table from the result of this query.  I did this to demonstrate the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">UNPIVOT</code> query, which performs
the opposite operation of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">PIVOT</code>:

My next Oracle discovery will be on PL/SQL!  I'm sure I will come back to these
discoveries when I use similar SQL queries in the future!  All the code is up on

In the client side code for my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype">
MEAN stack prototype</a> I used Sass for stylesheets instead of CSS.  I experimented with Sass
before, but this was my first time using it in a full project.  Until native CSS adds the features
that Sass provides, I will continue using Sass for stylesheets in the future.
</p>
<p>
Sass is a CSS preprocessor with Ruby style syntax.  Its a superset of CSS, so any CSS document is
valid Sass<sup>1</sup>.  Sass adds lots of new features including variable definitions, mixins,
and other syntax to help create reusable components in stylesheets.  The biggest problem I had
with CSS is that it ends up looking like a jumbled mess with many repeated styles.  With Sass,
I can create reusable styles!
</p>
<p>
In the past I played around with basic Sass features like inline comments and variables.  For
example, a variable can be defined for a color used throughout the application.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
$baby-blue: #8bb3f4;
$baby-blue-light: #ccdfff;
$light-gray: #aaa;
$off-white: #eee;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Variables can be referenced inside a CSS declaration:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
button {
    border-color: $baby-blue;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This time around I experimented with more complex Sass features.  I will discuss these exciting features next!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Mixins">Mixins</SectionTitle>
<p>
Mixins are an extremely powerful Sass property that create reusable style blocks.
Mixins are created with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@mixin</code> directive and are used
in a style declaration with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@include</code>
directive<sup>2</sup>.  For example, in my application I created a mixin for each of my fonts:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
@mixin dyslexie {
    background-color: transparent !important;
    font-family: 'Dyslexie', Helvetica, sans-serif !important;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Then I included the mixin in a declaration:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
body {
    @include dyslexie;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Every element in the website that needed a specific font used its mixin!  I also
used mixins to perform more complex operations like transformations.  Another powerful feature of
mixins is the ability to pass in arguments.  These arguments can also have default values!  Here is a
mixin that I created to apply a transition to a property:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
/**
* a mixin that simplifies transition generation
* @param $property - the property of the element that transitions
* @param $result - the resulting style of the transition
* @param $time - the time the transition takes to complete (optional)
*/
@mixin transition($property, $result, $time: .3s) {
    transition: #{$property} $time ease;

    // #{} syntax compiles the contents as a property name or selector
    &:hover {
        #{$property}: $result;
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This mixin creates a transition style for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">$property</code> parameter.  If no
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">$time</code> argument is passed to the mixin, the default 0.3 seconds is used.
</p>
<p>
Another cool piece of this code is the ampersand (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&amp;</code>)
placeholder.  This placeholder is a reference to the parent selector<sup>3</sup>.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">:hover</code> pseudo-class is applied to the parent
selector that the mixin is included in!
</p>
<p>
Here is some code where I include the transition mixin:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
#login-button {
    @include transition("background-color", $light-gray);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Mixins allow for reduced code and less repetition in Sass files!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Extends">Extends</SectionTitle>
<p>
When there are multiple selectors that use the same styles, each selector can extend a single class.
Here is an example:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
// Define a general style to be extended for &lt;span&gt; elements
.span-style {
    @include sylexiad;
    color: #990000;
}

span {
    @extend .span-style;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now all the styles in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.span-style</code> class are used in
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">span</code> element.  The best part is that this class can be
extended into other CSS selectors as well!  It is yet another great way to create reusable styling.
</p>
<p>
I'm having a ton of fun exploring Sass and all the exciting possibilities it offers.  While I hope
these features eventually make it into the native CSS spec, for now Sass is a nice alternative.  I'm
sure this won't be my last discovery on the matter!

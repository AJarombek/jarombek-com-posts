Today I updated my iOS app <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios">SaintsXCTF</a>
from Swift 3 to Swift 4.  The process could not have been easier, with many of the automated
conversions consisting of API changes and String struct upgrades.  There was however one change
that had me confused - many of my functions were given a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@objc</code>
annotation.  So what is this mysterious annotation and why was it added to so many of my methods?
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
@objc func womensXC(_ sender: UIView) {
    os_log("Go to Women's Cross Country Page", log: logTag, type: .debug)
    loadGroup(withGroupname: "wmensxc")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@objc</code> annotation allows for functions to interact with
Objective-C code<sup>1</sup>.  Since many of Apple's APIs are built in Objective-C, a lot of my functions
were actually interacting with non-Swift code without me even knowing!  This communication between
Swift and Objective-C is called Interoperability and it lets you use Objective-C code in Swift and vice
versa<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Why is Swift 4 enforcing the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@objc</code> annotation when Swift
3 didn't?  It looks like the Swift compiler used to infer the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
@objc</code> annotation for you, so you did not have to manually include it in your code<sup>3</sup>.
That has now changed in Swift 4.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons listed for enforcing the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">@objc</code> annotation
is that in Swift 3 it was never obvious if the annotation would be inferred by the compiler.  I would
argue however that having to use it in my code is more of a burden than a feature.  Now I
am even more dependent on an IDE than before, since I often do not know if I am interacting with an
Apple API written in Objective-C.  Some of my favorite languages are the ones that you can just write
in a text editor (one of Java's major weak points in my opinion is
that you are tied to an IDE), and Swift has now taken another step further away from that simplistic
nature.

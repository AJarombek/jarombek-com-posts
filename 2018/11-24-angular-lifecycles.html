When I learned AngularJS on my <a href="https://jarombek.com/resume?page=3">first software
development team</a> (June 2017), the biggest adjustment from JQuery was the addition of lifecycles for webpages.
With modern front-end libraries and frameworks such as <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
may-31-2018-react-seed">React</a> and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-17-2018-mean-stack-prototype">
Angular</a>, lifecycles are commonplace.  Although late to the party, in June 2017 they were brand
new to me.  This post looks at the lifecycles introduced in the Angular framework.  In a future post
I will look at lifecycles in React, drawing comparisons between the two front-end approaches.

As I've discussed in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions">
previous</a> <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-27-2018-angular-5-routing">posts</a>, Angular is
a front-end framework.  While you can use JavaScript to write Angular projects, TypeScript is
commonly used instead.  Angular projects consist of one or many modules.  Each module contains
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions#modules-components">
components</a>, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions#directives">
directives</a>, and other services.  As of today the latest version of Angular is 7.0.0.
</p>
<p>
Both Angular components and directives have lifecycles.  A common implementation of directives with lifecycles are
spies<sup>1</sup>.  Spies track the lifecycle of an HTML element in the DOM.  In my MEAN stack prototype,
I used a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-17-2018-mean-stack-prototype#post-page">spy directive
</a> to determine when <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;input&gt;</code> elements were created and
destroyed.  Spies utilize two lifecycle hook methods, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnInit()</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnDestroy()</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ngOnInit()</code> is invoked after a directive is initialized (its element is added to the DOM) and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnDestroy()</code> is invoked on directive destruction (its
element is removed from the DOM).  You can view the full code for the spy directive on
<a href="https://bit.ly/2DMzzdH">GitHub</a>.

The rest of this post will focus on the lifecycles of Angular components!

<SectionTitle title="Component Lifecycles">Component Lifecycles</SectionTitle>
<p>
Components have three different types of lifecycles - those for initialization, destruction, and
change detection<sup>2</sup>.  The Angular framework maintains a change detection mechanism which
monitors a component for its entire lifetime.  Each component gets its own change detector which keeps
the UI in sync with the component properties<sup>3</sup>.  Whenever a change occurs the UI is
re-rendered, invoking the appropriate lifecycle.  Each lifecycle has a corresponding hook method,
where custom logic is added.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at some of the most important lifecycle hook methods.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="constructor()" isCode="true">constructor()</SectionTitle>
<p>
A component class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">constructor()</code> is not a lifecycle hook method,
but I included it here since its invoked before any lifecycle hook methods are invoked.  The constructor also exists on every component class.
The constructor is limited in use because component properties aren't initialized yet when its called<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ngOnChanges()" isCode="true">ngOnChanges()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnChanges()</code> is a change detection lifecycle hook.  It's
invoked right after the constructor finishes executing for child components that are passed 
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@Input</code> properties.  If no <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
@Input</code> properties are bound to a component, this hook method isn't called.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ngOnInit()" isCode="true">ngOnInit()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnInit()</code> is an initialization lifecycle hook that is
very commonly used.  Its invoked after all the component properties are initialized.  I often used
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnInit()</code> to bind services to component properties.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ngDoCheck()" isCode="true">ngDoCheck()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngDoCheck()</code> is invoked every time a change occurs to a component.
Be warned - implementing this lifecycle hook can be very expensive since it runs every time the UI changes.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="ngOnDestroy()" isCode="true">ngOnDestroy()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ngOnDestroy()</code> is invoked when the component is destroyed.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Lifecycle Project">Lifecycle Project</SectionTitle>
<p>
I created an Angular project which displays each lifecycle hook invocation in the UI.  The code for
this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/
2018/11-Nov/11-24-angular-lifecycle">GitHub</a>.

Recently I learned a few JavaScript technologies for building website backends.  I looked
at <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-30-2017-nodejs-mongodb-api-prototype">Node.js</a> in the server layer and
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">MongoDB</a> in the database layer.  Now I'm switching gears and learning some front-end
JavaScript technologies.  My top two picks for front-end frameworks are Angular and React.js.  Today
I'm beginning my journey with Angular.  Through this research I will determine if its a suitable option for my website.  This post won't
display much code, instead focusing on my initial reactions to the framework.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Angular CLI">Angular CLI</SectionTitle>
<p>
Getting started, I struggled for a very long time setting up all my Angular dependencies.  I wanted to do it all
manually in the beginning so I could get to know the framework better.  I tried and failed for a
few hours and eventually gave up.  The problem was my Angular "hello world" code returned a blank screen
with no error messages (which is quite hard to debug).  I decided that I was in over my head with
this framework and had to choose an easier entry approach.
</p>
<p>
Luckily there is an easier option - the Angular CLI.  Angular CLI automates many common tasks in the Angular framework.  It builds new Angular projects,
creates new components, runs Angular code on a server and more<sup>1</sup>.  The Angular CLI is also a wrapper around
Webpack, performing all the module bundling for you<sup>2</sup>.  I don't yet know the details of Webpack,
so auto bundling makes Angular CLI really helpful.  Once I really understand the ins and outs of Angular, it may be nice
to have more control over a project than Angular CLI gives me.
</p>
<p>
The nicest thing about Angular CLI is how easy it is to setup a new project.  After Angular CLI is installed,
creating and running a new Angular project is as easy as the following two Bash commands.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Create a new Angular project with name 'developer'
ng new developer

# Start the Angular project on a server
ng serve
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The one thing that annoyed me about Angular CLI is how much content they put into the base Angular project.
The bloat included fully set up testing suites (multiple), a fully populated .gitignore file, and more.  For
someone who likes to customize my own project, this was overkill.  I ended up deleting most of these files
to get only the necessary components.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="TypeScript Language">TypeScript Language</SectionTitle>
<p>
The creators of Angular suggest that you use TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that is statically typed.
You can also use JavaScript, but I've decided to follow the advice and try TypeScript.  So far I've found
it to be more detrimental than beneficial.
</p>
<p>
Supposedly TypeScript is a true superset of JavaScript, meaning all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript
code.  However, in my first hacks at the language I had trouble using JavaScript features in TypeScript.
For example, when using a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">RegExp</code> in TypeScript I got errors saying
that its JavaScript functions did not exist.  This may be simply user error, but so far TypeScript has
not been the smooth transition it is advertised to be.
</p>
<p>
Also, using TypeScript disrupts my full JavaScript web stack.  Although TypeScript is
very similar to JavaScript, I still have to adjust to using two different languages when developing.
As my TypeScript experience grows I will see if I start seeing some benefits of the language.

<SectionTitle title="Modules Components">Modules &amp; Components</SectionTitle>
<p>
This post has been fairly negative, so I will take a break from that and look at some exciting things about
Angular that I can't wait to get my hands on.  Angular at its core is made up of modules that contain
components, directives, services, etc<sup>3</sup>.  When working with AngularJS I always
liked the modularized structure it gave my JavaScript code in comparison to my old JQuery spaghetti code.
Angular 5 seems even more modularized then AngularJS, which appears beneficial at first glance.
</p>
<p>
My "hello world" Angular project contains one module.  It is exported for use in other classes.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { DeveloperComponent } from './app.component';
import { ValidDevDirective } from './valid-dev.directive';

// Wrap a component and directive into a module.
// Each file can be one module which can be exported.
// You must import BrowserModule in the root module
@NgModule({
    imports: [BrowserModule],
    declarations: [DeveloperComponent, ValidDevDirective],
    bootstrap: [DeveloperComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@NgModule</code> annotation specifies that this class is an Angular
module.  Note that just like ES6 classes, TypeScript classes are not true classes.  They are transpiled
into JavaScript prototypes and are simply syntactic sugar.
</p>
<p>
The annotations object has a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">declarations</code> property that specifies all the members of the module<sup>4</sup>.
The first module member is a Component named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DeveloperComponent</code>.
Each component has a TypeScript class that defines model data and a view (which is usually HTML).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

// Create a new Angular component which can be used in HTML with the 'developer' tag
// Angular uses annotations as metadata
@Component({
    selector: 'developer',
    templateUrl: 'app.component.html'
})
export class DeveloperComponent {
    dev: string;

    constructor() {
        this.dev = 'Andy';
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The awesome thing about components is they define a reusable HTML tag.  Each HTML tag is named after the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@Component</code> annotations
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">selector</code> property.  The contents of a HTML tag are defined in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@Component</code> annotations
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">template</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">templateUrl</code>
properties.  The HTML contents render on a webpage at runtime, replacing the components HTML tag.
</p>
<p>
For example my code has an index.html file like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;developer&gt;&lt;/developer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When rendered in the browser, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;developer&gt;</code> tag is
replaced with the markup defined in my component:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;
        Hello {{ dev }}!
    &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter a developer name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="devInput" valid-dev&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The characters <code className="jarombek-inline-code">{{dev}}</code> in the HTML document
are replaced with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">dev</code> variables value in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DeveloperComponent</code> class.  This binding between
HTML and TypeScript creates many possibilities for dynamic webpages that I can't wait to explore!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Directives">Directives</SectionTitle>
<p>
The second module member is a directive called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ValidDevDirective</code>.
A directive is like a component except it has no view and is placed on an existing HTML element
<sup>5</sup>.  If you look at the HTML <code className="jarombek-inline-code">input</code> element in my component above you will see an attribute called
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">valid-dev</code>.  This attribute is defined in my directive, which right
now changes the border color of the input field when a value is entered.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
    selector: 'input[valid-dev]',
    host: {
        '(input)': 'onInput($event)'
    }
})
export class ValidDevDirective {
    renderer: any;
    element: any;

    constructor(renderer: Renderer2, element: ElementRef) {
        this.renderer = renderer;
        this.element = element;

        this.style('#ccc')
    }

    // When the value in the input field changes, check its contents
    onInput(event) {
        let value: string = event.target.value;

        if (value === '') {
            this.style('#ccc')
        } else {
            this.style('black')
        }
    }

    style(color) {
        this.renderer.setStyle(this.element.nativeElement, 'border-color', color)
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This is a very trivial implementation, but it is cool how directives extend the implementation of
HTML elements.  Reusable directives and components save time and lines of code
throughout a project.  Like components, I am excited to try out more complex directive implementations.

This was a quick glance at my first attempts with Angular 5.  I am not convinced Angular is the
solution for me yet, but there is still a lot of work and exploring to do.  Up next I will start
building a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-17-2018-mean-stack-prototype">full Angular project</a>!

In my previous <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-12-2018-oracle-start">Oracle database discovery</a>
I got a database instance up and running and created a basic table structure.  The database held programming
language information and books I've read.  In this discovery I continue with that example and perform
some interesting queries on the database of intermediate difficulty.
</p>
<p>
I believe intermediate queries are ones beyond simple select statements with basic filters.  This
discovery isn't a tutorial on creating SQL queries.  It explores different SQL syntax that
was interesting to me!  I will start out pretty simple and then get more complex.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Fun Queries">Fun Queries!</SectionTitle>
<p>
Often I perform queries with multiple <code className="jarombek-inline-code">WHERE</code> conditions chained
by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AND</code> clauses.  If I want to find whether a column is between two
different values, I can use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BETWEEN</code>
clause instead.  This makes my intentions clearer and reduces
the number of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">AND</code> clauses.  The following query looks for books
between two dates:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released
BETWEEN to_date('2014-08-01', 'YYYY-mm-dd')
AND to_date('2014-08-31', 'YYYY-mm-dd');
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">WHERE</code> clauses can also look for soft matches, where
only a portion of a string matches.  Soft matches use the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">LIKE</code> clause which can be chained with a
string value.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">%</code> wildcard is used to match any
number of characters.  The following query searches for books with titles containing the word 'Java':
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%Java%';
</CodeSnippet>
<span className="code-span">
ISBN TITLE            RELEASED  STARTED   FINISHED  TIME_READING
---- ---------------- --------- --------- --------- ------------
.... Java 8 in Action 01-AUG-14 10-OCT-17 08-FEB-18 121
</span>
<p>
The current table structure of this database forms a many to many relationship.  Here is the ER diagram:
</p>
<figure id="image">
    <img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/Database-ER.png">
</figure>
<p>
In the following query I perform an inner join across this many to many relationship to get a book, the
language its about, and the inception date of the language.  Inner joins only return rows when the
columns in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">JOIN ... ON ...</code> statement have non-null
values<sup>1</sup>.  Therefore, no row is returned for a language that has no corresponding book.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT b.isbn, b.title, bl.name, l.created
FROM books b
INNER JOIN book_languages bl ON b.isbn = bl.isbn
INNER JOIN languages l ON bl.name = l.name
ORDER BY b.title;
</CodeSnippet>
<span className="code-span">

You may want to make a SQL query that doesn't actually return the data in a table, but
instead returns different values depending on the underlying structure.  The following query does exactly that.
Depending on whether a book has a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">time_reading</code> value, it
returns 'Finished Reading' or 'Not Completed' (note: the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">time_reading
</code> column is a virtual column that is only generated when both a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
finished</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">started</code> date exist).  This operation is
performed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">nvl2()</code> function, which for its
first argument takes a column.  If this column isn't null, the second argument is returned.  Otherwise
the third argument is returned.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT title, nvl2(time_reading, 'Finished Reading', 'Not Completed') still_reading,
    CASE WHEN time_reading > 100 THEN 'Long Read'
        WHEN time_reading > 25 THEN 'Moderate Read'
        ELSE 'Short Read' END duration
FROM books;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
For if-else logic more complex than checking for null values, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CASE</code> statement is used<sup>2</sup>.
I checked if the time spent reading a book was greater than certain values, and if so returned a
different string.  Here is the result of this query:
</p>
<span className="code-span">
TITLE                       STILL_READING     DURATION
--------------------------- ----------------- -------------
Java 8 in Action            Finished Reading  Long Read
Oracle Database 12c SQL     Finished Reading  Moderate Read
AngularJS: Up and Running   Not Completed     Short Read
Jump Start: Bootstrap       Finished Reading  Short Read
Spring In Action            Finished Reading  Short Read
</span>
<p>
The next query looks at hierarchical data.  This data forms parent child relationships in
a tree structure.  The three tables in the database don't have any hierarchical data.
I changed that by creating a new table called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">language_hierarchy</code>
which stores data about languages and other languages that influenced them.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
-- Both name and influenced_by fields come from the language tables name column
CREATE TABLE language_hierarchy(
    name VARCHAR2(63),
    influnced_by VARCHAR2(63),
    CONSTRAINT language_hierarchy_name_fk
      FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES languages(name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT language_hierarchy_inf_by_fk
      FOREIGN KEY (influnced_by) REFERENCES languages(name) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
</CodeSnippet>
<span className="code-span">

<p>
The hierarchical nature of this data can be displayed using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
CONNECT BY PRIOR</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">START WITH</code> clauses.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">START WITH</code> defines a row to start the hierarchical analysis at
(it doesn't have to be the root node in the graph).  In the following query I started with the language 'C'
since so many modern languages are influenced by it. The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CONNECT BY
 PRIOR</code> clause defines the parent child relationship.  For example, let's say there are two rows where the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> column in row #1 equals
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">influenced_by</code> column in row #2.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CONNECT BY PRIOR name = influnced_by</code> statement says that row
#1 is the child node and has a relationship with parent node row #2.
</p>
<p>
Here is the full query:

<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT LEVEL, lpad(' ', 2 * LEVEL -1) || name AS language
FROM language_hierarchy
START WITH name = 'C'
CONNECT BY PRIOR name = influnced_by;

    <p>
You may be wondering about the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LEVEL</code> column.  This is a pseudo
column which indicates the level in the tree<sup>3</sup>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LEVEL</code> is
used along with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">lpad()</code> function to add tabs in front of the
language name.  In this example I started at the root column of the tree and
navigated downwards, but trees can also be traversed upwards from a child node.  This is achieved by
switching the columns in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CONNECT BY</code>
clause<sup>4</sup>.  In the following query I started at the language 'Java' and traversed the tree upwards.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT LEVEL, lpad(' ', 2 * LEVEL -1) || name AS language
FROM language_hierarchy
START WITH name = 'Java'
CONNECT BY PRIOR influnced_by = name;

Let say I want to group the time spent reading with the language I am reading about.  I can do this by joining the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">books</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">book_languages</code> tables
on the language name. I also use the aggregate function <code className="jarombek-inline-code">sum()</code> on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">time_reading</code> column.  Finally I want a row in the result set that totals
all the time spent reading.  This is where the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ROLLUP</code> clause comes
in.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ROLLUP</code> is used in conjunction with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
GROUP BY</code> clause to return a row with the subtotal for the grouping<sup>5</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
-- In this scenario you could also use the CUBE clause to the same effect.
SELECT l.name, sum(b.time_reading) FROM books b
    INNER JOIN book_languages l ON b.isbn = l.isbn
GROUP BY ROLLUP(l.name);
</CodeSnippet>
<span className="code-span">
NAME          SUM(B.TIME_READING)
------------- -------------------
Java          134
JavaScript
PL/SQL        26
SQL           26
              186
</span>
<p>
It would be nice if the name column in the
subtotal row displayed a name like 'Total Days'.  This behavior is implemented with the help of
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grouping()</code> function.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grouping()</code> accepts a column and
returns 1 if the column value is null and 0 if the value exists<sup>6</sup>.  In this example I
used the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grouping()</code> function along with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CASE</code> clause to populate the last rows
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> column.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT
    CASE grouping(l.name)
        WHEN 1 THEN '*Total Days'
        ELSE l.name
        END AS name,
    sum(b.time_reading) AS total_time_reading
    FROM books b
    INNER JOIN book_languages l ON b.isbn = l.isbn
GROUP BY ROLLUP(l.name);

I recently read a book discussing multiple inheritance in Python.  Python is one of the few
object oriented languages that permits multiple inheritance of classes.  Many other languages include
workarounds for multiple inheritance.  For example, Java allows for classes to implement multiple
interfaces.  On the other hand, PHP allows for classes to use multiple traits.  This article looks at
programming languages I use and how they enforce multiple inheritance or available workarounds.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is Multiple Inheritance?">What is Multiple Inheritance?</SectionTitle>
<p>
In object oriented programming, inheritance is when a class takes properties and methods from another
existing class.  With inheritance, hierarchies of class relationships are formed.  For example, class
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> which inherits properties and methods from class
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> forms an is-a relationship, such that
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> is an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code>.  All
the properties and methods from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> are passed along to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code>.  If another class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
C</code> inherits class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code>, its concluded that
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> is a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> is an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code>.
Therefore the following class hierarchy is formed:

</figure>
<Definition word="Multiple Inheritance">
When a class takes properties and methods from more than one existing class.  For example, class
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> might inherit from classes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
A</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code>. This is known as 'extending multiple classes.'
Most languages have specialized syntax to extend (inherit) a class. Multiple inheritance is unavailable
in many languages due to its complexity and ambiguity, although certain languages such as C++ and
Python enable it.
</Definition>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/12-22-18-hierarchy2.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
To understand the pitfalls of multiple inheritance, take the case where classes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
A</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> both have a method named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">execute()</code>.  When an instance of class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
C</code> invokes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">execute()</code>, is the method in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> called?
This is an ambiguous situation, and determining which one is invoked often comes down to documented rules.
</p>
<p>
Some object-oriented languages I use (such as Python) permit multiple inheritance.  Many others
prohibit multiple inheritance but provide safer workarounds.  The rest of this post looks at how
different languages handle multiple inheritance, in particular the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jan-16-2018-java-default-method">diamond problem</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="C++">C++</SectionTitle>
<p>
Although I don't really use C++, it's the language I always think of when hearing about multiple
inheritance.  C++ is one of the earliest languages I know of that implements multiple inheritance.
In fact, the troubles that multiple inheritance gave developers in C++ is what influenced James
Gosling (the creator of Java) to omit multiple inheritance from Java<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I'm not very good at C++, but I wrote an example of the diamond problem.  The following class
hierarchy relates to biological trees.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// Defines a generic tree
class Tree {
protected:
  int feet;
  int inches;
public:
  Tree(int feet, int inches) {
    cout << "Tree()" << endl;
    this->feet = feet;
    this->inches = inches;
  }

  // Calculates the height of the tree in inches
  int height() {
    return (this->feet * 12) + this->inches;
  }
};

// Defines a Christmas tree
class ChristmasTree: virtual public Tree {
public:
  ChristmasTree(int feet, int inches): Tree(feet, inches) {
    cout << "ChristmasTree()" << endl;
  }

  string type() {
    return "Christmas";
  }
};

// Defines an evergreen tree
class EvergreenTree: virtual public Tree {
public:
  EvergreenTree(int feet, int inches): Tree(feet, inches) {
    cout << "EvergreenTree()" << endl;
  }

  string type() {
    return "Evergreen";
  }
};

// Defines a balsam fir, which is a christmas tree and an evergreen tree
class BalsamFir: public ChristmasTree, public EvergreenTree {
public:
  BalsamFir(int feet, int inches): ChristmasTree(feet, inches), EvergreenTree(feet, inches), Tree(feet, inches) {
    cout << "BalsamFir()" << endl;
  }

  bool leafPeristence() {
    return EvergreenTree::type() == "Evergreen";
  }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
At the top is a generic <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code> class, which is extended by
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ChristmasTree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
EvergreenTree</code> classes.  Finally the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> class
extends both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ChristmasTree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
EvergreenTree</code>.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/12-22-18-hierarchy3.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
This code works fine except for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> method defined
in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ChristmasTree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
EvergreenTree</code>.  Invoking <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> on an instance of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> is ambiguous since it could come from either
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ChristmasTree</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
EvergreenTree</code>.  If you try to, the code won't compile.
</p>
<p>
The following is printed to stdout when invoking the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code>
constructor.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
int main() {
  BalsamFir balsamFir(7, 2);

  assert(balsamFir.height() == 86);
  assert(balsamFir.leafPeristence());

  return 0;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Tree()
ChristmasTree()
EvergreenTree()
BalsamFir()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that each class constructor is called once.  This isn't actually the default behavior of the
diamond problem in C++.  It's the result of virtual inheritance, which is implemented using the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">virtual</code> keyword on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ChristmasTree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">EvergreenTree</code> class definitions
where <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code> is extended.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
class ChristmasTree: virtual public Tree {...}

â€¦

class EvergreenTree: virtual public Tree {...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If the virtual keyword is removed from these class definitions, the code doesn't even compile.  What
impact does the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">virtual</code> keyword have?
</p>
<p>
When a class inherits another class in C++, the subclass retains a copy of all the properties and
methods in the parent class<sup>2</sup>.  The subclass also contains a copy of all the properties and
methods from inherited classes of the parent class.  This process of copying properties and methods continues
all the way up the class hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
As a result of these copies, an interesting issue forms in the diamond problem.  Subclass <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
BalsamFir</code> stores copies of the properties and methods in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ChristmasTree</code> and its parent class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code>.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> also stores copies of the properties and methods in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">EvergreenTree</code> and its parent class <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Tree</code>.  Notice that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> receives copies from
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code> twice - once from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ChristmasTree</code> and once from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">EvergreenTree</code>.  This is a
source of conflict that causes errors.
</p>
<p>
The fix to this issue is virtual inheritance, which is implemented using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
virtual</code> keyword.  With virtual inheritance, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code>
only receives one copy of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code>.
</p>

When writing Java, James Gosling thought the benefits of multiple inheritance were not worth the
risks and complexities.  Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes, instead using an
interface construct to simulate multiple inheritance.  When Java was first released, all
methods defined in interfaces had no bodies.  Instead, construction of method bodies were delegated
to implementing classes.
</p>
<p>
As of Java 8, methods in interfaces can have bodies.  These methods are called "default methods,"
and are mostly used for API backwards compatibility.  I wrote an article about
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-16-2018-java-default-method">default methods and the diamond problem</a>
back in January.  While I'll let you read that post for more insight, here is the biological tree hierarchy
implemented in Java:

In Groovy you can simulate multiple inheritance just like in Java.  However, Groovy introduces
an additional construct called a trait, which is designed with composition in mind<sup>3</sup>.
Classes implement traits, which give them additional functionality.  Classes can implement multiple
traits, simulating a multiple inheritance model just like Java interfaces with default methods.
In the case of naming conflicts for methods in traits, the method from the last trait declared after
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">implements</code> keyword is used in the class<sup>4</sup>.
You can see this rule at work in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> class.

<p>
PHP does not allow for multiple inheritance.  However, just like Groovy it has traits which can be
used to simulate multiple inheritance.  The biggest difference between traits in Groovy and PHP is
the way naming conflicts are resolved.  While Groovy picks the method from the last implemented trait
in the case of a conflict, PHP throws an error.  When a class uses multiple traits in PHP,
method names must be unique across all traits.  While this is stricter than Groovy, PHP classes that
inherit multiple traits are very predictable because of this enforcement.

I commented out the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> method in

The Swift implementation is quite unique.  Swift does not support multiple inheritance, but does
support protocols (equivalent to interfaces in Java, Groovy, and PHP).  Swift also has extensions,
which allow you to add functionality to an existing class or protocol.  One restriction enforced by extensions is that names
of variables and methods must be unique across all extensions for a class or protocol.
Therefore I couldn't create two extensions for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Tree</code> protocol
called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ChristmasTree</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
EvergreenTree</code> that both contain a variable named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code>.  Here
is my attempt at simulating multiple inheritance:

<CodeSnippet language="Swift">
/**

protocol Tree {

  /**

  func height() -> [String:Int]

typealias ChristmasTree = Tree

/**

extension ChristmasTree {

  var type: String {
    return "Christmas"
  }
}

typealias EvergreenTree = Tree

/**

extension EvergreenTree {
  // Can't redeclare var 'type', since it already exists in ChristmasTree

  var leaf_persistence: String {
    return "Evergreen"
  }
}

/**
 Implement the Tree protocol with the ChristmasTree and EvergreenTree extensions
 */
class BalsamFir: Tree {

  let feet: Int
  let inches: Int

  init(height: [String:Int]) {
    self.feet = height["feet"] ?? 0
    self.inches = height["inches"] ?? 0
  }

  /**
   Implement the height() method defined in the Tree protocol.

  func height() -> [String:Int] {
    return ["feet": self.feet, "inches": self.inches]
  }

  /**

   */
  func leafPersistence() -> Bool {
    return self.leaf_persistence == "Evergreen"
  }
}

JavaScript is unique amongst object oriented languages because it uses prototypes and prototype
chains for object hierarchies.  I wrote an entire post on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jun-9-2018-js-prototype">prototypes in JavaScript</a> if you want to learn more.
</p>
<p>
An object in JavaScript can only have a single prototype, so multiple inheritance is not allowed.
However, you can still use composition or mixins instead of inheritance.  After all, many say that
composition should be used over inheritance, as famously coined from the Gang of Four Design Patterns
book<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While slightly different than <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-6-2018-haskell-pt3">function
compositions</a>, object compositions are when an object contains other objects as properties.  These
other objects are used to give the enclosing object additional functionality.  For example,
a method invoked on the enclosing object can delegate that call to an object it contains as a property.
This is a way to inherit methods and properties from objects without dealing with the languages
inheritance mechanism.  Here is the function composition approach:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
/**
 * Base tree functionality - every tree should have a height
 * @type {{getHeight: function(): *}}
 */
const tree = {
  getHeight: () => this._height
};

/**
 * Evergreen tree functionality
 * @type {{type: function(): string, leafPersistence: boolean}}
 */
const evergreenTree = {
  type: () => "Evergreen",
  leafPersistence: true
};

/**
 * Christmas tree functionality
 * @type {{type: function(): string}}
 */
const christmasTree = {
  type: () => "Christmas"
};

/**
 * A balsam fir tree.  Use object composition with the tree, evergreen tree,
 * and christmas tree objects
 * @param height - how tall the tree is
 * @return {*}
 */
const balsamFir = (height) => {

  // Object composition
  this.tree = tree;
  this.evergreenTree = evergreenTree;
  this.christmasTree = christmasTree;

  this._height = height;

  // Delegate functions and properties to composed objects
  this.type = christmasTree.type;
  this.leafPersistence = evergreenTree.leafPersistence;
  this.getHeight = tree.getHeight;

  return this;
};

const balsam = balsamFir(7);

assert(balsam.getHeight() === 7);
assert(balsam.type() === "Christmas");
assert(balsam.leafPersistence);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Another option is to use mixins.  Mixins pass their contents to another object.  Here is the mixin approach
(everything stays the same except for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">balsamFir</code> object):
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
/**
 * A balsam fir tree.  Mix-in the tree, evergreen tree, and christmas tree objects
 * @param height - how tall the tree is
 * @return {*}
 */
const balsamFir = (height) => {
  this._height = height;

  // Combine 'this', the tree, evergreenTree, and christmasTree mixins.
  // Properties from the last mixed in object replace duplicates from prior objects
  return Object.assign(this, { ...tree, ...evergreenTree, ...christmasTree });
};

const balsam = balsamFir(7);

assert(balsam.getHeight() === 7);
assert(balsam.type() === "Christmas");
assert(balsam.leafPersistence);
</CodeSnippet>

Python shares the most similarities with C++ in regards to multiple inheritance.  Like C++, Python enables multiple
inheritance for classes, although it does not require virtual inheritance to function.  Unlike C++, the method
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> works fine in Python.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> didn't work in C++ because it was defined in two
different inherited classes.  Python objects maintain a method resolution order
that moves through the inherited classes in the order they are defined.  As soon as it encounters the
first <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> method in an inherited class, it gets invoked from
that class.  In the following example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> in class
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">BalsamFir</code> always delegates to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ChristmasTree</code> because its declared as the first superclass of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
BalsamFir</code>.

This post explored how different languages use multiple inheritance or comparable workarounds.
I'll add more languages to this list as I continue to explore!  All the code from this post is available

<UpdateInfo date="January 31st, 2019">
C# does not support multiple inheritance in its current version (7.0).  The inheritance features provided
by C# are comparable to those in Java prior to Java 8.  Therefore, object composition is needed to
create a multiple inheritance model in C#.  I demonstrate composing multiple objects on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/12-Dec/12-22-multiple-inheritance/

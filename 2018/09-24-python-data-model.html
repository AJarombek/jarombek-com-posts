This summer I started a trend of picking a different programming language each season to explore.
The language of the summer was <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-2-2018-groovy-basics-pt1">
Groovy</a>, which was selected because I used Groovy at work.  For the fall I’ve decided to
deep dive into Python.  Python was the first language I learned, beginning with
<a href="https://jarombek.com/resume">CS101</a> my freshman year of college.
</p>
<p>
Python is well documented as a beginner friendly language.  It is taught at most colleges to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-20-2018-intro-programming">introduce programming</a>.
The ease of learning Python does come at a price.  Very few master the language since they
feel there is no need to<sup>1</sup>.  The goal of dissecting Python this fall is to
truly understand everything the core language has to offer.  To begin, I will explore Python’s data
model.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Data Model for Objects">Data Model for Objects</SectionTitle>
<p>
The Python data model is a meta-object protocol.  I previously discussed meta-object protocols in
relation to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-14-2018-groovy-dynamic">Groovy</a>.  Another
example of a meta-object protocol is <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-1-2018-java-reflection">
Java’s reflection API</a>.
</p>
<Definition word="Meta-Object Protocol">
A meta-object protocol (MOP) is an API for a programming languages object system<sup>2</sup>.  Functions
of a MOP include <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-1-2018-java-reflection#type-introspection">type introspection</a>
and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-1-2018-java-reflection#reflection">reflection</a> of objects at runtime.  This means
you can observe and modify aspects of an object or program at runtime through the MOP.  A MOP is also
used for method dispatch, sometimes as an internal function and other times exposed in the protocols
API.  Languages often expose MOP methods for use in class definitions.
</Definition>
<p>
Python exposes many MOP methods for use on objects.  The MOP API allows developers to create objects
that interact with existing language features such as object construction, built-in functions, and
operators<sup>3</sup>.  Python refers to these methods as "special methods".  You have likely seen
them in Python code on a regular basis - they begin and end with two underscores (ex.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">__init__()</code>).
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Using Special Methods">Using Special Methods</SectionTitle>
<p>
I used Python's special methods in the past, but never knew they were part of the Python
data model (aka the MOP).  I decided to test out some special methods in two classes.
</p>
<p>
The first class represents a town with a name, population, date founded, and list of districts:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
class Town:

    def __init__(self, name, founded, population=0, districts=list()):
        self.name = name
        self.founded = founded
        self.population = population
        self.districts = districts

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Town of %s: Founded in %r with a Population of %r' % \
            (self.name, self.founded, self.population)

    def __len__(self):
        return datetime.now().year - self.founded

    def __getitem__(self, item):
        return self.districts[item]

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name \
            and self.founded == other.founded \
            and self.population == other.population \
            and self.districts == other.districts
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I use five special methods in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Town</code> class definition
- <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__init__()</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
__repr__()</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__len__()</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">__getitem__()</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
__eq__()</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__init__()</code> is pretty self explanatory,
it initializes a new object.  When an object constructor is called, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
__init__()</code> is invoked behind the scenes.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">

greenwich = Town('Greenwich', 1640, 62396, ['Riverside', 'Cos Cob', 'Old Greenwich', 'Greenwich'])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">__repr__()</code> is used to return a string representation of
an object, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__len__()</code> to get the length of an object,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">__getitem__()</code> to get an item at an index in an object,
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__eq__()</code> to determine equality between two objects.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Calls to len() invoke the __len__() special method
assert len(greenwich) == 378

# Indexing an object invokes the __getitem__() special method
assert greenwich[0] == 'Riverside'
assert greenwich[-2] == 'Old Greenwich'

# Implementing __getitem__() also allows for iteration over an object
for district in greenwich:
    assert district in ['Riverside', 'Cos Cob', 'Old Greenwich', 'Greenwich']

# Create a second town of Rye
rye = Town('Rye', 1660, 45928, ['Port Chester', 'Rye'])

# Test out the __eq__() special method
assert (greenwich == rye) is False

greenwich_clone = deepcopy(greenwich)
assert (greenwich == greenwich_clone) is True
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Its important to note that none of the special methods I defined are invoked directly.  All of them
are indirectly invoked through language operators or built-in functions.  For example, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">__len__()</code> special method is indirectly invoked when the
built-in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">len()</code> function is called.
</p>
<p>
The Python data model creates a standard API across all objects<sup>4</sup>.  Any object
that implements <code className="jarombek-inline-code">__getitem__()</code> can use the languages
indexing syntax.  To get the length of any object in Python, developers know they need to use the
built-in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">len()</code> function.  This is a vast improvement over
Java, where arrays use a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">length</code> property,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ArrayList</code> uses a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">size()
</code> method, and strings use a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">length()</code> method.  I had to
search through the Java documentation just to make sure I correctly remembered all these methods
(and Java is the language I’ve used the most!).
</p>
<p>
Now I am beginning to appreciate Python’s MOP and how predictable it makes the language.  If you are
interested, below is another class that uses special methods.  All the code from this article is
also on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/09-Sep/

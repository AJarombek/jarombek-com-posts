I often think that processing strings of characters in an application is a simple process.  The
reasoning behind this line of thought is that string APIs provided by programming languages are usually
very simple.  However, processing characters is only straightforward when edge cases are
avoided.  With the growth of Unicode and use of special characters (for localization, emojis, etc.), edge
cases are increasingly common.  This post explores the complexities of Unicode and how
programming languages support its edge cases.

<SectionTitle title="What is Unicode?">What is Unicode?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Unicode is a standard for creating character encodings and handling characters in a consistent
manner<sup>1</sup>.  Unicode was built upon older character encodings such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859">ISO 8859</a> and its subset
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>.  These old encodings have limited scope
(ASCII has just 128 characters),  making them inapt for international applications.  While
ASCII often works fine for applications used by English speakers in the United States (ASCII contains
the characters A-Z, numbers 0-9, punctuation, and common symbols), anyone else is out of luck.  Unicode
fixes these limitations, implementing characters from languages across the world, and even creating
fun symbols and emojis.  As of Unicode 11.0 over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_Unicode_characters">137,000 characters exist</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unicode is somewhat backwards compatible with ISO 8859 and ASCII.  For example, in some Unicode encodings the
character 'A' is the same in Unicode and ASCII, and any valid ASCII encoding is valid Unicode.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Character Encodings">Character Encodings</SectionTitle>
<p>
Unicode uses code points to identify each character.  Each code point is a four to six digit hexadecimal
number<sup>3</sup>.  Most languages allow unicode code points to be used in strings as escaped
sequences.  For example, the following JavaScript statement creates a string containing the Unicode
code point 0394.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const delta = '\u0394';
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The hexadecimal number 0394 represents a single Unicode character - the greek delta (Δ).  Unicode code
points are often prefixed with the character 'U' like so: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">U+0394</code>.
</p>
<p>
Things get confusing when we consider which character encoding the string
<code className="jarombek-inline-code"> '\u0394'</code> uses.  A reasonable guess is that it uses
the Unicode character encoding.  Unfortunately
it's not that simple.  Unicode is a standard for how to create character encodings, and there are
many different encoding formats that match the Unicode spec.
</p>
<p>
A character encoding is a way to identify a character with some kind of code<sup>2</sup>.  Unicode
has many different encodings, the most common being UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and UCS-2.

<ComparisonTable title="Unicode Encodings">

<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
UTF-8
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A character encoding for Unicode that uses between 1 and 4 bytes.  Each unit in UTF-8 is 8 bits, or
one byte.  The amount of bytes used to represent characters depends on the Unicode code point.  For
code points less than <code className="jarombek-inline-code">U+0074</code>, the encoding uses a single
byte<sup>4</sup>.  This encompasses most european languages and all of ASCII.  Since ASCII is also
encoded using one byte, the UTF-8 encoding is backwards compatible to ASCII for the first 128
characters<sup>5</sup>.  Since each unit in UTF-8 is one byte, the encoding is endianless.

<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
UTF-16
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A character encoding for Unicode that uses either 2 or 4 bytes.  Each unit in UTF-16 is 16 bits, or
two bytes<sup>6</sup>.  Similar to UTF-8, the number of bytes used to represent characters depends on
the Unicode code point.  Since each unit is two bytes long, the order in which these bytes are stored
is important.  Bytes can be stored in a little endian or big endian manner.  The endianness of UTF-16
is dependent on the Byte Order Mark (BOM), which consists of two byes at the beginning of the
encoding<sup>7</sup>.  The BOM bytes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">0xFF 0xFE</code> are used to
declare a little endian encoding, while the bytes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">0xFE 0xFF</code>
are used to declare a big endian encoding<sup>8</sup>.  Java uses UTF-16 to represent characters
<sup>9</sup> and most JavaScript engines use UTF-16 for character encoding<sup>10, 11</sup>.

<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
UTF-32
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A character encoding for Unicode that always uses 4 bytes.  Each unit in UTF-32 is 32 bits, or four
bytes.  Unlike UTF-8 and UTF-16, the number of bytes used to represent characters does not depend on
the Unicode code point.  All code points use 4 bytes.  Bytes can be stored in a little endian or big
endian manner.  The endianness of UTF-32 is dependent on the BOM, which consists of four byes at the
beginning of the encoding<sup>7</sup>.  The BOM bytes
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">0xFF 0xFE 0x00 0x00</code> are used to declare a little endian
encoding, while the bytes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">0x00 0x00 0xFE 0xFF</code> are used to
declare a big endian encoding<sup>8</sup>.  Since all code points in UTF-32 use 4 bytes, it is very
easy to determine the length of a string using this encoding.  However, UTF-32 is memory
intensive, since there are often many wasted bytes (as you can see in the BOM where some bytes are
empty - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">0x00</code>)<sup>12</sup>.

only supports a subsection of Unicode called the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).  The BMP contains
characters from most modern languages and symbols, however some common characters (such as certain
emojis) reside outside the BMP<sup>13</sup>.

Let's look at different Unicode encodings in Python code.  The following strings represent two
different ways of writing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">'beyoncé'</code> in Unicode.
The escaped sequences (ex. <code className="jarombek-inline-code">\u0301</code>) are Unicode code points.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Two different unicode representations of 'beyoncé'
b = 'beyonce\u0301'
b2 = 'beyonc\u00E9'

print(b)   # beyoncé
print(b2)  # beyoncé

# While both representations appear the same, they are not considered equal
assert not b == b2

# The UTF-8 byte encodings.  \xcc\x81 is equivalent to (U+0301), the unicode code point for
# a 'combining acute accent' (https://bit.ly/2OGrmwC)
assert b.encode('utf8') == b'beyonce\xcc\x81'

# \xc3\xa9 is equivalent to (U+00E9), the unicode code point for 'é'
assert b2.encode('utf8') == b'beyonc\xc3\xa9'

# The UTF-16 encoding for 'beyonce\u0301'.  Each character is at least 2 bytes long, compared to
# UTF-8 where characters that are compatible with ASCII are encoded with 1 byte.
assert b.encode('utf-16') == b'\xff\xfeb\x00e\x00y\x00o\x00n\x00c\x00e\x00\x01\x03'

# The UTF-32 encoding for 'beyonce\u0301'.
assert b.encode('utf-32') == b'\xff\xfe\x00\x00b\x00\x00\x00e\x00\x00\x00y\x00\x00\x00' \
                             b'o\x00\x00\x00n\x00\x00\x00c\x00\x00\x00e\x00\x00\x00\x01\x03\x00\x00'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Note the differences between encoding in UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.  For this simple string, UTF-8
is by far the most memory efficient.
</p>
<p>
This code also reveals some complexities of the Unicode standard.  Strings can look the same, but
use different code points under the hood.  Unicode complexities cause issues, especially
when checking for equality between two strings.  Upon observing the strings in variables
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b2</code>, you
would expect them to be equal.  However, the first assertion statement reveals they are not.  If
you checked the length of these two strings, the result may also be a surprise:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Both representations have different lengths.
# 'beyoncé' appears to have length 7, however variable 'b' resolves to length 8
assert len(b) == 8
assert len(b2) == 7
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Since variable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code> used two code points (
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">\u0065\u0301</code>) to represent 'é', Python says it has length
8, even though the human readable representation has 7 characters.  The 'e' code point (
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">\u0065</code>) is called a
base character and the accent code point (
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">\u0301</code>) is called a combining character.  Code points are defined this way since
combining characters are merged with base characters to create a single visible character<sup>15</sup>.
To solve the issue of length and equality disparity in Unicode strings (in large part thanks to
combining and base characters), normalization is used.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Normalization">Normalization</SectionTitle>
<p>
Normalization in Unicode is the process of transforming code points to match a certain
standard.  Once a standard is matched, it is likely that our prior issues of mismatching string
lengths and inequality will be fixed.  There are four Unicode normalized forms: NFC, NFD, NFKC,
and NFKD.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Unicode Normalization Forms">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Normalization Form C (NFC)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
NFC first decomposes each code point, expanding each into all its possible base characters and
combining characters (ex. 'é' can be decomposed into 'e' and the accent character).  Once all
the characters are decomposed, NFC recomposes each one based on canonical equivalence<sup>16</sup>.
With canonical equivalence, two characters are equivalent if they have the same appearance and
meaning when written<sup>17</sup>.  In many languages, NFC is the default normalization implementation.
NFC is <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-5-2018-graphql-pt1#idempotent">idempotent</a>, so
normalizing a string multiple times has the same result as normalizing it once.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Normalization Form D (NFD)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
NFD decomposes each code point, expanding each into all its possible base characters and combining
characters.  Decomposed characters are sorted in a standardized manner, and equivalence is
determined by canonical equivalence.  Similar to NFC, NFD is idempotent.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Normalization Form KC (NFKC)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
NFKC is the same as NFC except it decomposes and recomposes based on compatibility instead of
canonical equivalence.  With compatibility, characters can look completely different, but still be deemed
equivalent in certain contexts.  NFKC is a stronger form of normalization and is lossy, unlike NFC
which is lossless.  However, NFKC is still idempotent like NFC.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Normalization Form KD (NFKD)
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
NFKD is the same as NFD except it decomposes based on compatibility instead of canonical
equivalence.  Just like NFKC, NFKD is lossy.  It is also idempotent, making all four Unicode normalization
forms safe to use multiple times without side effects.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
The following code uses NFC to normalize the two 'beyoncé' strings in Python.  NFC can easily be
replaced here with the other three normalization techniques:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Normalize both strings using the form NFC
normalized_b = normalize('NFC', b)
normalized_b2 = normalize('NFC', b2)

assert len(normalized_b) == 7
assert len(normalized_b2) == 7

assert normalized_b == normalized_b2
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
After normalization, both 'beyoncé' strings have the same length and are deemed equivalent.
</p>
<p>
Almost all languages support Unicode to some extent.  The following JavaScript code
attempts the same operations I showed throughout this post (along with a bonus look at emojis!).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const b = 'beyonce\u0301'; // beyoncé
const b2 = 'beyonc\u00E9'; // beyoncé

// Both appear to have 7 characters, yet variable 'b' which uses combining characters
// (it combines 'e' and '\u0301', the second of which is a diacritic) is listed
// as having length 8.
assert(b.length === 8);
assert(b2.length === 7);

// While the two strings appear the same, JavaScript does not recognize them as equal
assert(b !== b2);

// Normalize defaults to NFC normalization
const b_norm = b.normalize();
assert(b_norm.length === 7);

// Once normalized, the two strings are equal
assert(b.normalize() === b2.normalize());

// The length of emojis are also greater than one
const smiley = '😊';
assert(smiley.length === 2);

// Find the actual length of an emoji
assert([...smiley].length === 1);

const emojis = '🦌\u{1F98C}';

assert(emojis.length === 4);
assert([...emojis].length === 2);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
And the following does the same in Java:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public static void main(String... args) {
  String b = "beyonce\u0301";
  String b2 = "beyonc\u00E9";

  assert b.length() == 8;
  assert b2.length() == 7;

  assert !b.equals(b2);

  // Normalize both strings using NFC
  String normalized_b = Normalizer.normalize(b, Normalizer.Form.NFC);
  String normalized_b2 = Normalizer.normalize(b, Normalizer.Form.NFC);

  assert normalized_b.length() == 7;
  assert normalized_b2.length() == 7;

  assert normalized_b.equals(normalized_b2);

  String smiley = "😊";
  assert smiley.length() == 2;

  // In order to get the proper length of unicode,
  // length must be measured by unicode code point instead of character.
  assert smiley.codePointCount(0, smiley.length()) == 1;
}
</CodeSnippet>

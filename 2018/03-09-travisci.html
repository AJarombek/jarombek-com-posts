My MEAN stack prototype is the first personal project that uses Continuous Integration (CI).
Continuous Integration is great and I will likely use it in all future projects.
</p>
<p>
So what is CI?  Continuous Integration is the practice of merging code in development into a main
repository on a regular basis.  On each of these merges, testing suites and builds are executed automatically
by a tool separate from the main codebase<sup>1</sup>.  This allows
for early detection of bugs and helps avoid the nightmare of backtracking through many commits to see
where some functionality broke.  With CI each time a commit is made the developer knows if
any existing code broke.  Of course this requires some thorough
testing suites to be created (something I often cut corners on admittedly).
</p>
<p>
So yes, I have a bad habit of thinking about unit/integration testing as an afterthought.  Like any
bad habit, it is time to start breaking it with small baby steps!  The first of those steps includes
setting up each project with a CI service, and in this case I
chose TravisCI because of how easily it integrates with GitHub repositories!
</p>
<p>
After signing up for <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>
and enabling it on for certain repositories, GitHub notifies Travis each time new commits are
pushed<sup>2</sup>!  I set up TravisCI for both the client side and server side of my MEAN stack prototype.
Let’s take a look at the configuration file (named .travis.yml) and see what it does for each project!

Let’s break this file down.  I set the language to a Node.js flavor of
JavaScript by writing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">language: node_js</code>.  My TravisCI config
runs tests on two different Node.js versions.  I did this to test out how backwards
compatible my project was!  Even though the project uses TypeScript and not Node.js, I guess specifying
the language as Node.js basically tells Travis "This project uses npm."
</p>
<p>
The Angular configuration was a bit more complex than the server side config because of some complexities
thanks to Angular CLI.  For whatever reason, you
have to install Chrome in the build in order to get the Karma tests to run properly<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Accomplishing this requires use of the apt add-on.  The apt add-on provides commands to the
apt-get package handler for installation<sup>4</sup>.
I specified that I want to install <code className="jarombek-inline-code">google-chrome</code>
from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">google-chrome-stable</code> package.
</p>
<p>
Before the script is run I tell TravisCI to install AngularCLI (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">
npm install -g @angular/cli</code>).  This allows TravisCI to use the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ng</code> commands.  Then I specified
that the tests should run and that a build should execute.  If both of these commands succeed, TravisCI's
success criteria is met.  Finally, code coverage statistics are sent to <a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coveralls</a>
, another really cool tool that easily integrates with GitHub.
</p>
<p>
After TravisCI finishes executing the scripts, there is an option to send notifications about the build details.  I
decided to have emails sent out each time a build finished,
no matter if it succeeded or failed.  Notifications are very easily configurable to fit your needs.

<p>
Just by glancing at this code you will see that not much changed from the Angular frontend
configuration.  Node.js is used as the language, a test
script is run, and email notifications are sent out on success and failure.

With TravisCI the first baby step has been taken towards a full
fledged test suite with continuous integration!  I'll be using TravisCI in my projects for the
foreseeable future.

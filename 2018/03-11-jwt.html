<p>
For my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-client-prototype">MEAN stack prototype</a>
I had to implement user authentication.  For example, if a user wanted to create a new post,
I had to make sure that they were signed in.  After looking at multiple solutions I settled on JSON Web
Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
</p>
<p>
JWT's are used to securely transfer a series of claims between parties<sup>1</sup>.  In my application,
these claims determine whether a user is signed in.  The parties that these claims are transferred
between are the Node.js/Express web server and my Angular 5 client.
</p>
<p>
A JWT is a Base64 encoded JSON object along with an algorithm used for signing.  It contains a header, payload,
and signature<sup>2</sup>.  These three components are separated by a period in the Base64 encoding like so:
</p>
<span class="code-span">
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.
eyJpYXQiOjE1MjAzOTI5NDIsImV4cCI6MTUyMDM5NjU0Miwic3ViIjoiNWE5NjE2IyZThiZDBiZDVlIn0.
dGQU3FsuuOy9-IEEMHGTPB1bCOOk_28d_vofg56h9
</span>
<p>
In the above JWT the first line is the header, the second line is the payload, and third line the
signature.  The header carries claims about the JWT itself.  In my use case, there was only one claim
 - the algorithm to sign the JWT.  This algorithm was RS256, which is RSA along with SHA256.  More on this later.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
    "alg": "RS256"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The payload contains user data about the JWT.  This is the data that I wanted transferred in the
first place.  In my implementation the JWT payload has three claims.  The first is the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">sub</code> claim, which identifies the subject that the claim
is about.  In my application, the subject is the user that is logged in.  The second claim is
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">iat</code> claim, which specifies when the JWT was issued.
The final claim is the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">exp</code> claim, which is the expiration
time of the JWT.  Both the issued time and expiration time are specified in UNIX time, or the
number of seconds since midnight January 1st, 1970.  Here is a sample decoded payload from my application:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
    "iat": 1520392942,
    "exp": 1520396542,
    "sub": "5a9616e6c5631b2e8bd0bd5e"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you look at the issued time and expiration time closely, you can see there is a difference of 3,600
between the two.  That means the JWT was valid for an hour after it was issued.
</p>
<p>
The signature, also known as JSON Web Signature, is a really cool portion of JWTs that helps make them so
powerful.  The signature is how you determine the authenticity of a JWT<sup>3</sup>.  The signature
does not prevent users from decoding the header and payload of the JWT.  Instead it is used to perform
authentication based on which algorithm is used to sign the JWT.  The algorithm used in my implementation
is RSA.
</p>
<p>
RSA is an algorithm that generates two keys: a public key and a private key<sup>4</sup>.  The private
key can both create a signed JWT and authenticate it, while the public key can only authenticate it
<sup>5</sup>.  This creates some interesting application possibilities
since you can give applications a public key and restrict them from signing JWTs.  My Node.js/Express
server simply held both the private and public key, using the private one to sign JWTs and the public
one to authenticate.
</p>
<p>
Next I will go through the JWT setup for my MEAN stack.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="MEAN Stack implementation">MEAN Stack implementation</SectionTitle>
<p>
The first step in setting up the MEAN stack with JWT is to install some dependencies that simplify
JWT incorporation and generate both the private and public keys with RSA.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Dependency used to setup JSON Web Token user authentication
npm install jsonwebtoken --save

# Handle middleware commonly used with JWT
npm install express-jwt --save

# Generate a new RS256 key for a JSON Web Token
# ssh-keygen is used for creating auth pairs for SSH
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f private.key

# Generate public key from the private key
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -outform PEM -out private.key.pub
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The next step is to create a login REST endpoint in the Node.js backend.  If the correct username and
password is sent to this endpoint, a new JWT is created and sent back to the user.  The subject in the
JWT payload is the ID of the user in MongoDB.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt-nodejs');
const jwtUtils = require('../utils/jwt');

const routes = (User) => {

    const authRouter = express.Router();

    authRouter.route('/login')
        .post((req, res) => {

            const username = req.body.username;
            const password = req.body.password;

            getToken().catch(error => {console.error(error); res.status(500).send(error)});

            async function getToken() {

                const user = await User.findOne({username: username}).exec();

                // Synchronously compare the password submitted and the hashed value in MongoDB
                if(bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {

                    console.info("Valid Username and Password Entered!");

                    // Create the JWT string for authentication
                    const jwtBearerToken = jwt.sign({}, jwtUtils.RSA_PRIVATE_KEY, {
                        algorithm: 'RS256',
                        expiresIn: 3600,
                        subject: user._id.toString()
                    });

                    // Send the client the JWT along with its expiration date.  Another
                    // popular option is to send JWT in a cookie instead of the HTTP body
                    res.status(200).json({
                        idToken: jwtBearerToken,
                        expiresIn: 3600
                    });

                } else {
                    res.status(401).send('Not Authorized');
                }
            }
        });

    return authRouter;
};

module.exports = routes;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I use the private key to sign the JWT.  I separated out variables that reference the
private key, public key, and JWT authentication function in a utility class.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

// Private key for the RS256 encryption signature
const RSA_PRIVATE_KEY = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../private.key'));

exports.RSA_PRIVATE_KEY = RSA_PRIVATE_KEY;

// Public key for the RS256 encryption signature
const RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../private.key.pub'));

exports.RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = RSA_PUBLIC_KEY;

// Middleware for dealing with JWT tokens on HTTP requests
exports.checkIfAuthenticated = expressJwt({
    secret: RSA_PUBLIC_KEY
});

module.exports = exports;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
That authentication function is used on all routes that require a JWT:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
postRouter.route('/')
    .post(checkIfAuthenticated, (req, res) => {/* Endpoint Implementation */});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now the backend is completely set up.  Let's switch to the Angular 5 frontend.  I created an
authentication service that sends a request to the login endpoint for a JWT.  If it gets a JWT as a
response, it places it in localStorage.  The service also has
helper methods for logging out (removing the JWT from localStorage) and checking if the JWT hasn't
expired (the users session is still valid).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {HttpClient} from "@angular/common/http";
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
import {Observable} from "rxjs/Observable";
import * as moment from "moment";

@Injectable()
export class AuthenticationService {

    private SECOND = 'second';

    constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

    // Login a user and create a new session
    login(username: string, password: string) {

    return this.http.post&lt;any&gt;(`/api/auth/login`, { username: username, password: password})
        .map(jwtAuth => {

            // Add the JWT to localStorage
            if (jwtAuth) {

                // Get the time JWT expires by adding the current time and the expires in time
                const expiresAt: moment.Moment = moment().add(this.SECOND, jwtAuth.expiresIn);

                localStorage.setItem('id_token', jwtAuth.idToken);
                localStorage.setItem('expires_at', JSON.stringify(expiresAt.valueOf()));
                localStorage.setItem('username', username);

                return new Observable(data => {
                    data.next('Signed In!');
                });
            } else {
                return new Observable(data => {
                    data.error('Invalid Username or Password');
                });
            }
        });
    }

    // Log out the current user by removing the session from LocalStorage
    static logout() {
        localStorage.removeItem('id_token');
        localStorage.removeItem('expires_at');
        localStorage.removeItem('username');
    }

    // Determine if the user is logged in based on the JWT expiration date
    static isLoggedIn() {
        const loggedIn: boolean = moment().isBefore(this.getExpiration());

        if (!loggedIn &amp;&amp; localStorage.getItem('id_token')) {
            AuthenticationService.logout()
        }

        return loggedIn;
    }

    // Get the expiration date of the JWT session from localStorage
    static getExpiration(): moment.Moment {
        const expiresAt = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expires_at'));
        return moment(expiresAt);
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When navigating to routes in the application that are only accessible to signed in users, the
Angular components check to see if the JWT is still valid.  If its not valid, users are redirected
back to the login form.
</p>
<p>
Finally on all outgoing HTTP requests I attached the JWT to the request body.  This is so
that the JWT can be verified by the Node.js/Express server.
I set up this functionality with an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">HttpInterceptor</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";
import {HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest} from "@angular/common/http";
import {Observable} from "rxjs/Observable";

// Intercept outbound HTTP requests.  If user is authorized, add a new header to HTTP request.
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {

    private LOG_TAG: string = '[AuthInterceptor]';

    intercept(req: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;any&gt;&gt; {

        const idToken = localStorage.getItem('id_token');

        if (idToken) {

            // If the JWT exists, set it as an HTTP header on outbound requests
            const authReq = req.clone({
                headers: req.headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer " + idToken)
            });

            return next.handle(authReq);
        } else {

            // If there is no JWT, send original HTTP request without an Authorization header
            return next.handle(req);
        }
    }

}

<p>
I'm sure this won't be the last time I explore JWT.  I'm also really interested in how exactly the
authentication algorithms work!  Huge shout out to Angular University<sup>5</sup> and Auth0<sup>6</sup>
for helping me get set up with JWT!

In my recent programming adventures, I’ve run into a lot of code that follows a functional style.
Many object-oriented and imperative programming languages added basic functional programming features
to their specs, including <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-8-2018-java8-functional">Java 8</a>
in 2014.  I’ve spent time looking at functional programming features in these languages, such as
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-27-2018-groovy-currying#what-is-currying?">currying</a> and
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-16-2018-groovy-closures">lambda functions</a>.  Learning the
functional programming style through a traditional object-oriented language is fine, but I really
wanted to apply functional concepts in a language built upon the functional programming paradigm.  Over
the past few weeks, I’ve spent some of my free time reading about Haskell, a functional programming
language.  This post covers some of the functional concepts I explored in my first 200 lines of Haskell code.

<SectionTitle title="Guarded Equations">Guarded Equations</SectionTitle>
<p>
Often when writing a program with branching outcomes, a conditional expression is used.  Haskell
also supports <code class="jarombek-inline-code">if...else</code> conditional expressions, which are
used like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Determine if a number is higher (older), equal to, or lower (younger)
  than my age using conditional expressions
-}
older :: Int -> Int
older n = if n > 23 then 1
          else if n == 23 then 0
          else -1
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Invoking <code class="jarombek-inline-code">older 24</code> returns <code class="jarombek-inline-code">1
</code> while <code class="jarombek-inline-code">older 22</code> returns <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
-1</code>.  Another way to perform the same logic is to use a guarded equation.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Determine if a number is higher (older), equal to, or lower (younger)
  than my age using guarded equations
-}
older' :: Int -> Int
older' n | n > 23 = 1
         | n == 23 = 0
         | otherwise = -1
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Guarded equations follow a more mathematical design, using a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
| condition = outcome</code> syntax which is read "Such that a condition is met, return an outcome<sup>1</sup>."  Guarded
equations are easily translated into mathematical equations<sup>2</sup>.  The following equation
represents the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">older'</code> function:
</p>
<MathNotation tex="﻿older'(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x > 23 \\ 0 & x = 23 \\ -1 & otherwise \end{cases}"></MathNotation>
<p>
The following function demonstrates a more advanced example of guarded equations.  It returns a
sub-list from a list using recursion and the cons operator (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">:</code>),
which constructs a list.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
subList :: Int -> Int -> [a] -> [a]
subList _ _ [] = []
subList _ 0 _ = []
subList s e (x:xs) | s <= 0 && e > 0 = x : subList s (e - 1) xs
                   | s <= 0 && e <= 0 = []
                   | otherwise = subList (s - 1) (e - 1) xs
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Lambda Expressions">Lambda Expressions</SectionTitle>
<p>
I use lambda functions (also known as arrow functions in some languages) all the time in my code.
In many languages, lambda functions are tacked on features, but in Haskell they are an integral part
of the language.  The following two functions demonstrate lambda expressions in Haskell.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Multiply two numbers together.  Curried functions are easier to understand
  when the lambda function syntax is used.
-}
mult :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
mult = \x -> (\y -> x * y)

{-|
  An age function which returns a constant value of my age.  Written to utilize lambda functions.
-}
age' :: a -> Int
age' = \_ -> 23
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you are curious about curried functions, I devoted an entire article to them with a sub-section
applying strictly to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-27-2018-groovy-currying#currying">
currying in Haskell</a>.

<SectionTitle title="List Comprehensions">List Comprehensions</SectionTitle>
<p>
In mathematics, set comprehensions (also known as set-builder notation) are used to construct a set
that abides by certain rules<sup>3</sup>.  A set comprehension often takes an existing set and filters
or maps it to match certain criteria, resulting in a new set.
</p>
<p>
In Haskell, comprehensions are used to construct lists from existing lists<sup>4</sup>.  The following
function uses a list comprehension to square all items in a list and then calculate the sum of the
new list.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
sumListSq :: Num a => [a] -> a
sumListSq xs = sum [x^2 | x <- xs]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The list comprehension notation <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[x^2 | x <- xs]</code> is read as
"item <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code> drawn from list
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">xs</code> such that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x^2</code>".
When <code class="jarombek-inline-code">sumListSq [2,3,4]</code>
is invoked, the list is mapped to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[4,9,16]</code> first.  Then the sum of
the list is calculated, which is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">29</code>.
</p>
<p>
Like many constructs in Haskell, list comprehensions are easily translated into mathematical notation:
</p>
<MathNotation tex="\{x^2 \: | \: x \in xs\}"></MathNotation>
<p>
More advanced list comprehensions can work with multiple lists:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Create a list of grid indices for a grid of a certain length and height
-}
grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
grid x y = [(a, b) | a <- [0..x], b <- [0..y]]
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
> grid 2 3
[(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)]
> grid 0 0
[(0,0)]
</CodeSnippet>
<MathNotation tex="﻿﻿\{(x', y') \: | \: x' \in \{0..x\}, \: y' \in \{0..y\}\}"></MathNotation>
<p>
These list comprehensions mapped each item in a list to a new value.  List comprehensions
can also use filters to only operate on and return certain items from a list.  A list comprehension
filter is called a guard, and is placed in a list comprehension following the source list and a comma.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Get the grid coordinates for the perimeter of a square.
-}
square :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]
square x = [(a, b) | (a, b) <- grid x x, a == 0 || b == 0 || a == x || b == x]

{-|
  Extract the vowels from a String.  Uses a guard in the list comprehension which filters the generator
-}
vowels :: String -> String
vowels str = [s | s <- str, elem s "aeiouAEIOU"]
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
> square 1
[(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]
> square 2
[(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)]

> vowels "Andy Jarombek"
"Aaoe"
> vowels "Greenwich,CT"
"eei"
</CodeSnippet>

Haskell is a challenging language to get accustomed to, but I am really enjoying it.  I'm also
learning many new functional programming concepts and how they closely relate to mathematical
concepts.  All the Haskell code from this discovery and more is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2018/10-Oct/10-06-haskell-pt1">GitHub</a>.

A common higher-order function in functional programming is a fold (also referred to as reduce or
inject depending on the language).  The goal of a fold is to take a list and reduce it into a single
value.  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-6-2018-haskell-pt1">Haskell</a> implements multiple
fold functions, each of which has a different implementation.  This article clears up the differences
between each fold function and introduces some simple use cases.

<SectionTitle title="foldl and foldr">
<code class="jarombek-header-code">foldl</code> and <code class="jarombek-header-code">foldr</code>
</SectionTitle>
<p>
The two main fold functions in Haskell are <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code>, both of which are found in the standard
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Prelude</code> module.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code>
and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> take three arguments.  The first argument is
a list (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">xs</code>) which the single returned value is reduced
from.  The second argument is a base value (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code>).
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code> is the result of a fold function with an empty list argument.
If a populated list is passed as an argument, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code> assists in
building a reduced value.  How a reduced value is created depends on the third argument to fold, a function.
</p>
<p>
This function (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">f</code>) takes in two arguments - the base value
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code> and an item from the list <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">f</code> performs an operation on <code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code>
and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code>, returning a single value.  Fold is a recursive function,
so each item in the list <code class="jarombek-inline-code">xs</code> passes through
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">f</code>, resulting in a single value after the list is exhausted.
</p>
<p>
The difference between <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
foldl</code> is how the recursion is applied to list items.  The following function is a recreation of
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Redefining the fold-right recursive function for reference
  (a -> b -> b) - a function that takes a list item 'a' and an accumulator 'b' and performs an operation
                    on 'a' that combines it with 'b'
              b - the starting value for the accumulator
            [a] - a list to operate on
-}
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f v [] = v
foldr f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr f v xs)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The following code uses <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> to add up all the items in a list.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
foldr (+) 0 [1..10] -- 55
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To begin, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> invokes function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
f</code> on the first list item <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code> and the recursive case
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">(foldr f v xs)</code>.  Finally once <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
foldr</code> has been recursively called enough times to exhaust the list, the base case is returned.
This type of fold function is known as a ‘right fold’ since the computed result folds over from the
right<sup>1</sup>.  Visually this is hard to picture, I’ll show you an example in a bit.
</p>
<p>
The other type of fold is a ‘left fold’ which Haskell implements with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
foldl</code> function.  I recreated <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Redefining the fold-left recursive function for reference
  (a -> b -> a) - a function that takes an accumulator 'a' and a list item 'b' and performs an operation
                    on 'b' that combines it with 'a'
              a - a starting value for the accumulator
            [b] - a list to operate on
-}
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl f v [] = v
foldl f v (x:xs) = foldl f (f v x) xs
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The following code uses <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> to add up all the items in a list.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
foldl (+) 0 [1..10] -- 55
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The only difference between <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> is the recursive case.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
foldl</code> immediately invokes function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">f</code> on the first list
item <code class="jarombek-inline-code">x</code> and the base value <code class="jarombek-inline-code">v</code>.
The result of this invocation (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">f v x</code>) is passed as the new base
value to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code>.  This type of fold function is known as a 'left fold'
since the computed result folds over from the left.
</p>
<p>
The concepts of folding left and right are quite confusing at first.  Using the fold functions to create
a string representation of their execution pattern is a helpful way to visualize the differences between
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code><sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The following two functions are used to debug <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
{-|
  Visualize the execution of the foldr function.
  Inspiration from: https://wiki.haskell.org/Fold#Examples
-}
debug_foldr :: [String] -> String -> String
debug_foldr xs s = foldr (\x y -> "(" ++ x ++ "+" ++ y ++ ")") s xs

{-|
  Visualize the execution of the foldl function
-}
debug_foldl :: [String] -> String -> String
debug_foldl xs s = foldl (\x y -> "(" ++ x ++ "+" ++ y ++ ")") s xs
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Invoking these two functions on a list <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[1..10]</code> reveals how
recursion constructs the final result.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
main :: IO ()
main = do
  print( debug_foldr (map show [1..10]) "0" )
  print( debug_foldl (map show [1..10]) "0" )
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
"(1+(2+(3+(4+(5+(6+(7+(8+(9+(10+0))))))))))"
"((((((((((0+1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)+7)+8)+9)+10)"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> result
in nested addition operations.  Since <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> folds over from the
right, the right most operation <code class="jarombek-inline-code">10+0</code> is computed first, then
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">9+10</code>, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">8+19</code>, etc.
Since <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> folds over from the left, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
0+1</code> is computed first, then <code class="jarombek-inline-code">1+2</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">3+3</code>, etc.

<SectionTitle title="Issues with Large Lists">Issues with Large Lists</SectionTitle>
<p>
Using <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code>
on small lists is no problem.  However, once lists get extremely large they start to cause issues.
</p>
<p>
First I attempted invoking <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> with a list of 100 million
elements on my MacBook.  Unfortunately it resulted in a stack overflow error.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
print( foldr (+) 0 [0..100000000] )
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
*** Exception: stack overflow
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
What happens is each time a recursive call is made, a new item is pushed onto the programs call stack.
The reason why the recursive function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> grows the call
stack is because it lacks a reducible expression until the list is exhausted<sup>3</sup>.  Because of
this the call stack grows until a reducible expression is encountered.
</p>
<Definition word="Reducible Expression">
In programming languages any expression that can be reduced or altered into a simpler or different
value.  For example, a function invocation that requires work to be done is a reducible expression,
while a constant value that doesn’t change is not<sup>4</sup>.    Reducible expressions are commonly
referred to as 'redexes<sup>5</sup>.'
</Definition>
<p>
The execution of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr (+) 0 [0..100000000]</code> doesn’t encounter
a reducible expression until <code class="jarombek-inline-code">100000000+0</code>, and before the recursion
reaches that point the stack was already out of memory on my machine.
</p>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> is different because it has a reducible expression in each
recursive case.  Unfortunately <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> also runs into a memory issue.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">
print( foldl (+) 0 [0..100000000] )
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
*** Exception:
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When I ran this code no further exception information was given, but according to the Haskell documentation
this code runs out of heap space.  Every reduction in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code>
is executed lazily, so instead of immediately storing the result of a reducible expression, Haskell stores
the reducible expression on the heap.  This lazy behavior is expensive in terms of heap space, and operating
on a large list can overflow the allocated heap memory.
</p>
<p>
Luckily there is a fold function implementation that works with large lists.

<SectionTitle title="foldl and foldr"><code class="jarombek-header-code">foldl'</code></SectionTitle>

<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl’</code> is a left folding function located in the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Data.List</code> module.  It is implemented using a native
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">seq</code> function to remove the lazy behavior of redexes<sup>6,7</sup>.

In the example code so far I’ve used <code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldr</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">foldl</code> to add up the contents of a list.  The following two use
cases count the number of odd numbers in a list and divide the items in a list.  I wrote the examples
using standard recursion first and then altered them to use the fold functions.

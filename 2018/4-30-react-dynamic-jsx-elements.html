Recently I've spent a lot of time working with React.js for my upcoming website (which by the time
you are reading this is completed!).  One of the challenges I faced was dynamically deciding at
runtime which JSX element to render.  It turns out there is a pretty nice solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
First off, if you have been following by posts you will know that this is the first time I have posted
about React.js.  Therefore lets quickly review/initiate ourselves with the React library.
</p>
<p>
React.js is a frontend library written in JavaScript for creating and maintaining views.  Unlike the
Angular framework which I was using before, React does not control any aspect of your project besides
for the views.  This makes it quite lightweight and gives the developer a lot of flexibility and freedom.
</p>
<p>
Let’s quickly run through some of the major selling points of React.  React creates a virtual layer on top
of the DOM called the Virtual DOM.  React uses the virtual DOM to interact with the real DOM API, allowing
the developer to avoid interacting with the DOM itself<sup>1</sup>.  React also has an extremely
effective diffing algorithm which makes updates to the DOM quick by only changing necessary
pieces of the DOM on state changes<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
React is also isomorphic (can be run on multiple platforms), meaning that it does not necessarily
have to render its views on the DOM<sup>3</sup>.  It can also render HTML on the server (server-side
rendering) or on mobile apps!  I haven’t explored React Native for mobile apps yet but it sounds extremely
cool!  My website takes advantage of server-side rendering, which I will cover in detail in a future discovery.
</p>
<p>
Also importantly React tries to take advantage of JavaScripts functional aspects.  Much of my React code is
functional, and working with React helps me to think functionally - making my code more testable and
maintainable.  I went into detail on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-8-2018-java8-functional">
functional programming in Java</a> in a previous discovery and all
the benefits that come with it.  These benefits also carry over to JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
So, how to we work with the virtual DOM that React offers us?  We do so with React elements, which correspond
to HTML elements.  These React elements are JavaScript objects that we can manipulate.  We can even group
together React elements into a modularized component.  These components can be passed to the virtual DOM
as well.  When a component is passed to the virtual DOM, the elements inside it will be rendered.  This
practice allows us to make easily reusable HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a React component that I will use later on:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";

const Link = ({ name, link }) =>
    React.createElement("a", {href: link}, name);

export default Link;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This React component is very simple, it creates a new React element which corresponds to the HTML
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element.  This element has an
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">href</code> attribute which links it to a url passed in to the component via
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">link</code>.  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element
also displays the text passed to the component by the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> property.
</p>
<p>
The function <code class="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> is what creates the React element
corresponding to an HTML element.  You can image how tiresome and verbose it would be to type out this
function call for every single HTML element that you wanted a webpage to display.  Luckily there is an
alternative, JSX.  JSX allows us to create React elements in a syntax that looks like HTML.  Here is an
example of the previous component except with JSX:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";

const Link = ({ name, link }) =>
&lt;a href={link}&gt;
    {name}
&lt;/a&gt;;

export default Link;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As you can see, it is much more readable and will be easier to write (although yes, it is a bit of an eyesore
at first having to mix HTML syntax with JavaScript code).
</p>
<p>
Now lets get to the issue I faced when building my website.  I wanted to dynamically choose the JSX element type
at runtime based on some JSON that I received from my server.  For example, if the JSON had a property
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">tag</code> with the value <code class="jarombek-inline-code">div</code>,
I would want the JSX element to represent an HTML <code class="jarombek-inline-code">div</code>.  With this
implemented, I could store a JSON representation of some HTML and have my React code create and render it on the fly.
</p>
<p>
The code used by my website is a bit more involved than what I will show you but I’m going to cover the
basic process.  First I import react and the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Link</code> component I created.
I also get a JavaScript object representation of some HTML I want to display:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import Link from "./Link";

const elements = [
    {
        tag: "h1",
        attributes: null,
        value: "Webpage Title"
    },
    {
        tag: "p",
        attributes: null,
        value: "Hey"
    },
    {
        tag: "Link",
        attributes: {
            name: "Check out my GitHub!",
            link: "https://github.com/AJarombek"
        },
        value: "Ok"
    }
];
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The object representation of HTML has three properties.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">tag</code>
represents the HTML element type, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">attributes</code> lists the HTML
attributes, and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> is the content shown inside the HTML tag.
</p>
<p>
Next I need to loop through this <code class="jarombek-inline-code">elements</code> array and generate some
JSX for each object.  This JSX will then be rendered in the websites HTML.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const App = () =>
    elements.map(e => {
        let Tag = e.tag;

        // If we are using a custom react component, we must
        // assign it directly.
        if (Tag === "Link") {
            Tag = Link;
        }

        return (
        &lt;Tag key={e.toString()} {...e.attributes}&gt;
            {e.value}
        &lt;/Tag&gt;
        );
    });

render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The important piece here is that we create a variable <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Tag</code> on the
third line which represents the JSX element.  Remember that a JSX element is simply syntactic sugar for a
React element (which itself is a JavaScript object) that will be sent to the virtual DOM.
</p>
<p>
Native HTML elements are passed to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> as a
string.  This is why the code above works for <code class="jarombek-inline-code">h1</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">p</code> element names.  If you tried assigning the string “Link” to the variable
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Tag</code> it would not render.  The reason is because
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;Link&gt;</code> is not a valid HTML element!  It is a React component
that I created!  The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">React.createElement()</code> will take in React
components as well, but you have to pass it the actual component module.  This is the reason for the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">if</code> clause in the code above.
</p>

Here is the end result:

I still have a lot of learning and work to do with React.  So far I have really enjoyed it despite a few
shortcomings that I miss from frameworks such as Angular.  But that is for another post!

I'll be honest - most of the time when I write CSS I just hack away at things until they work.
Building layouts in CSS never seemed intuitive to me.  Other methods such as Androids XML layout
system always seems more beginner friendly and powerful.  Luckily creating web layouts in CSS gets
easier every year.  New features are added to CSS, and in the past year a new layout method
called CSS Grid was added to the language specification.  Now instead of using a library such as
Bootstrap to manage page layouts, CSS has native support for easy grid layout management.  I used
CSS Grid in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-31-2018-react-seed">React</a>/
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-4-2018-webpack-seed">Webpack</a> prototype back in March
and applied it to every page on this website so far!  I think CSS Grid is a major enhancement to
the CSS specification, providing an easier entry point to new developers.  This post looks into
the basics of CSS Grid and acts as a stepping stone for further CSS discoveries down the line.

My software development journey began just two years ago in 2016 - so for the first 20 years of the
CSS lifespan I was not around.  Recently however I had to write some HTML and CSS for an email
template.  The HTML email I created is sent from this website when someone subscribes.   When I first began
development on the email I thought it would be an easy task - create a few
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, write some CSS Grid styling, and
call it a day.  Little did I know that creating an HTML and CSS email is like building a website
in 1999.
</p>
<p>
In order to get the email layout to work on all clients, the HTML had to be formatted using
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;table&gt;</code> elements<sup>1</sup>.  None of the layout
could be handled in CSS.  The worst offender of all email clients was Outlook, which didn't even
support the CSS <code className="jarombek-inline-code">width</code> property<sup>2</sup>!  You can
checkout the <a href="https://gist.github.com/AJarombek/5e8df26bcb3ca8f8f6b4d66640381141">gnarly
HTML and CSS code for my email</a> in all its beauty.
</p>
<p>
Luckily in recent years we didn't have to create layouts with HTML tables or define element
widths as HTML attributes.  We did it all in CSS!  Before CSS Grid (and after the 90's) creating
layouts consisted of either playing around with the CSS <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
position</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">float</code> declarations or giving up and
using a library such as Bootstrap to handle layout creation for you.
</p>
<p>
When I started developing my first website <a href="https://www.saintsxctf.com/">SaintsXCTF</a> in
the fall of 2016, CSS Grid did not yet exist.  At that point I was a beginner and
didn't know bootstrap existed.  If you look at most of the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf/blob/master/views/style.css">websites code</a>
all the layouts are created by floating <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>
elements around the page and manipulating the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">position</code>
attribute.  I won't go in detail of how to use this technique here, but it's safe to say it
was challenging and confusing.  Clearly the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">float</code>
attribute wasn't meant for designing layouts<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Luckily CSS has evolved and introduced two new ways to create layouts natively - flexbox and grid.
This post is about CSS Grid and the power it gives developers and designers.
</p>
<Definition word="CSS Grid">
Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that uses rows and columns to format HTML<sup>4</sup>.
CSS Grid replaces hacks such as CSS floats for creating layouts.  It also is more powerful at
creating grid layouts than Flexbox, which is a one-dimensional layout system.  CSS Grid was first
introduced in 2017 and is currently supported on <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid">most
major browsers</a> (as of June 2018).

To demonstrate how CSS grid works I designed a UI which displays different runs I went on
this past week.  Before using CSS Grid, here is what the UI looked like:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-18-grid-0.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Now let's start working with CSS Grid.  In order to create a grid, a container HTML element must
be given the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">display: grid</code> CSS definition.  The columns
in the grid are defined with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-columns</code> declarations and
the rows are defined with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-rows</code> declarations.
</p>
<p>
The following <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.container</code> class holds all the runs
I went on:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div className="container"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="CSS">
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Two additional things to note about the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.container</code> class.
You will notice that I use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">fr</code> unit, which represents
a fraction of the space in a CSS Grid container.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
grid-template-columns</code> declaration specifies two columns with equal widths.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-gap</code> declaration specifies the space between grid
items.
</p>
<p>
Inside the container there are seven HTML <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;div&gt;</code>
elements for the running logs.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HTML">
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-17-0 run-6"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-16-0 run-7"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-15-2 run-5"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-15-1 run-6"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-15-0 run-5"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-14-0 run-8"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="run run-6-13-0 run-4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the initial CSS Grid layout I designed, the columns and rows are specified in each running log:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="CSS">
.run-6-17-0 {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1;
}

.run-6-16-0 {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.run-6-15-2 {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 2;
}

.run-6-15-1 {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 3 / 5;
}

.run-6-15-0 {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 3;
}

.run-6-14-0 {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 5;
}

.run-6-13-0 {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 5;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The result:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-18-grid-1.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Notice that nothing is filling the grid space with column #2 and row #4.  CSS
Grid allows for easy declarations of whitespace in a layout.
</p>
<p>
One issue with the above code is it's quite lengthy for such a simple layout.  To make a grid
definition less verbose, the CSS properties <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-area</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-areas</code> are used.  The following
code creates the same exact layout as the previous one:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="CSS">
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;

  grid-template-areas:
        "a b"
        "c b"
        "d e"
        "d ."
        "f g";
}

.run-6-17-0 { grid-area: a; }
.run-6-16-0 { grid-area: b; }
.run-6-15-2 { grid-area: c; }
.run-6-15-1 { grid-area: d; }
.run-6-15-0 { grid-area: e; }
.run-6-14-0 { grid-area: f; }
.run-6-13-0 { grid-area: g; }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-area</code> gives each grid item a unique identifier and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-areas</code> defines the pattern for the grid.
Note that the grid area with column #2 and row #4 is declared with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.</code> token, denoting an empty grid space.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-columns</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">grid-template-rows</code> are powerful because
you can give unique identifiers to each line in between grid items.  These unique
identifiers are used within the grid items CSS declaration block for placement in the grid.
Here are unique grid edge identifiers in action:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="CSS">
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: [left] 1fr [middle-start] 2fr [middle-end] 1fr [right];
  grid-template-rows: [row-1] 1fr [row-2] 1fr [row-3] 1fr [bottom];
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.run-6-17-0 {
  /* Specify the items location within the grid */
  grid-column-start: left;
  grid-column-end: middle-start;
  grid-row-start: row-1;
  grid-row-end: row-3;
}

.run-6-16-0 {
  /*
  Shorthand for specifying each column and rows start and end
  Goes in this order: row-start, column-start, row-end, column-end
  */
  grid-area: row-3 / middle-start / bottom / middle-end;
}

.run-6-15-2 {
  grid-area: row-1 / middle-end / row-2 / right;
}

.run-6-15-1 {
  grid-area: row-1 / middle-start / row-3 / middle-end;
}

.run-6-15-0 {
  grid-area: row-3 / left / bottom / middle-start;
}

.run-6-14-0 {
  grid-area: row-2 / middle-end / row-3 / right;
}

.run-6-13-0 {
  grid-area: row-3 / middle-end / bottom / right;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The result:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-18-grid-2.png"/>

<p>
From all these examples, you may have noticed that each grid item stretches to fit its grid
position.  This behavior comes from each items <code className="jarombek-inline-code">align-self</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">justify-self</code> properties, which default to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">stretch</code><sup>5</sup>.  You can declare these properties
with different values to change their behavior<sup>6</sup> (I often use
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">center</code> which retains the shape of the original HTML
element).

This concludes my brief introduction to CSS Grid.  Hopefully you have seen why I am so excited
about this new specification and the power it gives developers and designers to create layouts on
the web.  It has never been easier to design webpages with native CSS, and I am excited to continue
growing my stylesheet knowledge.

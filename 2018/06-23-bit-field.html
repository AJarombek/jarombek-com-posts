<p>
I was recently reading a book on Java and read through a chapter on how to use bit fields.  Bit
Fields are a data structure that I never really understood completely (along with most of the
bitwise operators), so I figured I would take some time to look at Bit Fields in detail.
</p>
<Definition word="Bit Field">
A data structure that consists of one or many memory locations (bits).  Each of these bits has a
unique meaning defined by the programmer<sup>1</sup>.  It is common practice to use an unsigned
integer data type of a specified length for a bit field.  For example, in C you can define a
bit field as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">unsigned int bitField : 2</code>.  This bit field
consists of two bits which can be turned on or off - each of which has a unique meaning defined
by the programmer.
</Definition>
<p>
I decided to go back to C for my bit field implementation since the data structure is often used
in situations where low memory consumption is imperative.  While I am no master at C, I really
enjoy playing around with the language and hope to understand it to a greater capacity some day.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Bit Field C Implementation">Bit Field C Implementation</SectionTitle>
<p>
I started my implementation by defining some bit masks along with a type definition representing
a user.  The last field in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">User</code> type definition -
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">statusField</code> - is a 3-bit field.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
#define VALIDATED 01
#define SUBSCRIBED 02
#define ADMIN 04

typedef struct {
  char first[31];
  char last[31];
  unsigned int statusField : 3;
} User;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The preprocessor definitions for this code are three bit masks which can be applied to the bit
field.  Every time a macro such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">VALIDATED</code> is used
in the code, its occurrence is replaced with the definitions replacement text (ex.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">VALIDATED</code> is replaced with
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">01</code>)<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="Bit Mask">
A bit mask is a series of bits used to perform operations on another series of bits.
A mask is commonly used to check for the existence of certain bits or remove/add certain bits to a
value<sup>3, 4</sup>.  For example, letâ€™s say we have a series of bits
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">010</code>.  If we wanted to toggle on the first bit in the
previous sequence, we can use the bit mask <code class="jarombek-inline-code">001</code> and
perform a bitwise OR operation.   The result of <code class="jarombek-inline-code">010 | 001</code>
is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">011</code>, so the first bit was successfully toggled on by the bit mask.
</Definition>
<p>
The <code class="jarombek-inline-code">typedef struct</code> code defines a new data type that
has multiple fields - a users first and last name along with a bit field containing their
status<sup>5</sup>.  The bit field represents a users privileges/status on an online website.
</p>
<p>
Next I wrote some code to declare a new user type and set its bit field to
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">000</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
int main()
{
  User andy;
  strcpy(andy.first, "Andrew");
  strcpy(andy.last, "Jarombek");

  // Set the status as 000
  andy.statusField = 0;

  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now comes the interesting part.  I set up some functions to alter bits in the bit field using
bit masks.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
/**
* Add a status to the bit field on a user type
* @param user - a User type
* @param mask - the status to add to the bit field
*/
void addStatus(User *user, unsigned int mask) {
  user->statusField |= mask;
}

/**
* Remove a status from the bit field on a user type
* @param user - a User type
* @param mask - the status to add to the bit field
*/
void removeStatus(User *user, unsigned int mask) {
  user->statusField &= ~mask;
}

/**
* Check to see if a status is in the bit field
* @param bitField - a bit field to search through
* @param mask - a bit mask to bitwise 'and' with the bit field
* @return 0 if the mask doesn't exist in the bit field, an integer >= 1 otherwise
*/
int containsStatus(unsigned int bitField, unsigned int mask) {
  return bitField & mask;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To turn on bits in a bit field, the bitwise OR operation is performed between the bit field and
the mask.  For example, <code class="jarombek-inline-code">000 | 010</code> results in the
middle bit being turned on - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">010</code>.
</p>
<p>
To turn off bits in the bit field, the bitwise AND and NOT operators are used.  For example,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">011 & ~010</code> turns off the middle bit, resulting
in <code class="jarombek-inline-code">001</code>.
</p>
<p>
To check if a bit is turned on in a bit field, a simple bitwise AND is used between the bit field
and the mask.  If the value resulting from the bitwise AND is greater than 0, the bit is turned
on in the field.  Otherwise, its turned off.  For example,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">011 & 010</code> checks if the middle bit is turned on.
Since the result is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">010</code> or
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">2</code>, we know that the bit is turned on in the bit field.
</p>
<p>
The bit masks are the preprocessor macros <code class="jarombek-inline-code">VALIDATED</code>,
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">SUBSCRIBED</code>, and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">ADMIN</code>.  They are used in the following code to turn on
bits, turn off bits, and check for existence of bits in the bit field.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">

// Set the status as 000
andy.statusField = 0;

printUser(andy);

// Validate the user, change the status from 000 to 001
addStatus(&andy, VALIDATED);

// Give the user admin rights, change the status from 001 to 101

Bit fields can also be used in Java.  The following code for a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
User</code> class defines static final variables for the bit masks.  Note that in Java all
integers are signed and 32 bits long, so you have 31 bits to play with in a bit field data structure.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public final class User {

  /* Flags for different statuses */
  static final int VALIDATED = 1;
  static final int SUBSCRIBED = 2;
  static final int ADMIN = 4;

  private int statusBitField;
  private String first;
  private String last;

  // Package-private constructor for the user.  The bit field is defaulted to a value of 0.
  User(String first, String last) {
    statusBitField = 0;
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
  }

  // private constructor that takes in a bit field.
  private User(String first, String last, int bitField) {
    this.statusBitField = bitField;
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
  }

  // Add a status to the users bit field
  static User addStatus(User user, int status) {
    int updatedStatusBitField = user.statusBitField | status;

    return new User(user.first, user.last, updatedStatusBitField);
  }

  // Remove a status from the users bit field
  static User removeStatus(User user, int status) {
    int updatedStatusBitField = user.statusBitField & ~status;

    return new User(user.first, user.last, updatedStatusBitField);
  }

  // Perform an action (supplied by the second argument) when given a boolean
  // representing the existence of a status for the user.
  void containsStatus(int mask, Consumer&lt;Boolean&gt; action) {
    action.accept(containsStatus(mask));
  }

  // Check for the existance of a status in a bit field
  boolean containsStatus(int mask) {
    return (statusBitField & mask) &gt; 0;
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The following code performs operations on the user class, similar to the C implementation.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
// Base user has a bit field of value 000
User user = new User("Andy", "Jarombek");

// Add the validated flag to the bit field: 000 -> 001
User validatedUser = User.addStatus(user, User.VALIDATED);

// Add the admin flag to the bit field: 001 -> 101
User adminUser = User.addStatus(validatedUser, User.ADMIN);

// Remove the admin flag from the bit field: 101 -> 001
User revokedAdminUser = User.removeStatus(adminUser, User.ADMIN);

// Add the subscribed flag to the bit field: 001 -> 011
User subscribedUser = User.addStatus(revokedAdminUser, User.SUBSCRIBED);

System.out.println(user);
System.out.println(validatedUser);
System.out.println(adminUser);
System.out.println(revokedAdminUser);
System.out.println(subscribedUser);

// Check to see if the user has different statuses based on the bit field
subscribedUser.containsStatus(User.VALIDATED,
    (bool) -> System.out.println("User is Validated: " + bool));

subscribedUser.containsStatus(User.SUBSCRIBED,
    (bool) -> System.out.println("User is Subscribed: " + bool));

subscribedUser.containsStatus(User.ADMIN,
    (bool) -> System.out.println("User is Admin: " + bool));

<p>
While you can use bit fields in Java like the previous implementation, using primitive
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">int</code> variables for bit fields goes against some of Javaâ€™s
core principles.  Using <code class="jarombek-inline-code">int</code> primitives for bit fields
is not type safe - which is often a crucial requirement for a Java data structure<sup>6</sup>.
Luckily there is a type safe approach for bit fields in Java.  This approach uses the
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">EnumSet</code> collection to store the fields.  The fields
themselves are represented as enums.  This approach is not only type safe and more readable, but
also has the same performance as the non-safe integer approach.
</p>
<p>
The code for the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">EnumSet</code> approach is on GitHub in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2018/06-Jun/
6-23-Bit-Field/Java/EnumSetUser.java">EnumSetUser</a> and

Researching bit fields was a really valuable exercise to gain further knowledge of bitwise
operations and low level data structures.  Expect more discoveries on Java and C in the future.

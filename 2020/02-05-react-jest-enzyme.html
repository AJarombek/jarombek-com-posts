In an article last fall I spoke about my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
oct-26-2019-unit-test-aws-infrastructure">change in mindset towards unit testing</a>.  In my early programming
days I thought unit tests slowed down development to a fault.  Nowadays they are mandatory in all my
applications.  Unit tests are assertions that a unit of code is working as expected in isolation of
other components in the codebase.  They help promote code review, catch recurring bugs, and ease the
burden of upgrading and switching technologies.
</p>
<p>
For React applications, the de facto testing framework is <a href="https://jestjs.io/en/">Jest</a>.  Jest
was written by Facebook with React unit testing in mind, making it a natural fit.  Alongside Jest,
<a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/">Enzyme</a> is used to test React components.  Enzyme was created by
AirBnB to render components for testing.  It provides an API to traverse the rendered DOM nodes in a
component and hook into stateful component instances.
</p>
<p>
My previous article consisted of a demo application which showcasing the new features in React 16.3 with
detailed descriptions and sample components.  The demo is a React application, so naturally I created a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/tree/master/app/test">testing suite</a> with Jest
and Enzyme.
</p>
<p>
This article walks through the testing suite, providing insights about Jest and Enzyme in the process.

Any npm project begins with the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/
package.json">package.json</a> file and the application dependencies.  For the sake of brevity I only listed
the dependencies needed for unit testing.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "react": "16.12.0",
    "react-dom": "16.12.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.1.2"
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "enzyme": "^3.11.0",
    "enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.15.1",

    "react-test-renderer": "^16.12.0",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
React is a standard dependency while Jest and Enzyme are dev dependencies.  As its name suggests, dev
dependencies are used for development purposes only.  When a repository is cloned and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">npm install</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
yarn</code> are invoked, both standard and dev dependencies are installed.  However, when a module
is installed with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">npm install {module_name}</code> or
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">yarn add {module_name}</code>, only standard dependencies are
installed.  We don’t want unit testing frameworks to be installed for module end-users, so their
dependency definitions always exist in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">devDependencies</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">jest</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
enzyme</code> dev dependencies are the Jest testing framework and Enzyme testing utility, respectively.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">enzyme-adapter-react-16</code> is used to configure Enzyme to
work with React 16 code.  There are many Enzyme adapters, ranging from React versions 0.13 to 16<sup>1</sup>.  I will configure the React 16 adapter soon.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">react-test-renderer</code> renders React elements and components
as JavaScript objects without needing the DOM<sup>2</sup>.  It’s used for component snapshot testing.
</p>
<p>
With <strong>package.json</strong> initialized, it’s time to create the applications Jest configuration.
The Jest configuration is located alongside <strong>package.json</strong> in <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/jest.config.js">jest.config.js</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
module.exports = {
  displayName: 'components',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  testMatch: ['**/test/**/*.test.js'],
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['&lt;rootDir>/test/setupTests.js'],
  maxConcurrency: 5,
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(png)$': '../../test/mocks/fileMock.js'
  },
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest'
  },
  collectCoverage: true,
  collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.js'],
  coveragePathIgnorePatterns: ['src/index.js'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    'global': {
      'branches': 100,
      'functions': 100,
      'lines': 100,
      'statements': 100
    }
  }
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<strong>jest.config.js</strong> configures the testing suite for the application.  Let’s highlight some
important aspects of the configuration.  Tests are executed in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
jsdom</code> environment, a headless browser which provides rendered components access to the DOM and
DOM API.  Any file in the <strong>test</strong> directory (or its subdirectories) with the
<strong>.test.js</strong> file extension is executed in the test suite.  The Enzyme adapter is configured
in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/test/setupTests.js">
setupTests.js</a> file, which has a very simple body:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import {configure} from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Before testing, all Javascript files are transpiled with Babel and non-JavaScript imports are mocked with
a file named <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/test/mocks/fileMock.js">
fileMock.js</a>.  This file contains a single line:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
module.exports = 'test-file-stub';
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All that remains in the Jest configuration file is code coverage setup.  All source code JavaScript files
are tested for code coverage (except for <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/
app/src/index.js">index.js</a> which consists of React and React Router bootstrapping.  In order for the
test suite to pass, code coverage must be 100%.
</p>
<Definition word="Code Coverage">
Code coverage is the percentage of a program that executes in a test suite.  Code coverage is usually run
alongside tests, and generates a text or html report.  While 100% code coverage is ideal, it isn’t always
practical or necessary.  Likewise, 100% code coverage doesn’t mean that code is properly tested.  Poorly
written tests count towards code coverage the same as properly written ones!
</Definition>
<p>
At this point the test suite is fully configured!  In my experience Jest configuration is pretty easy to
work with.  Without much work, I created a test suite that is executable with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">jest</code> command.  I often alias this command in my
<strong>package.json</strong>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I wrote three types of tests for my React 16.3 demo - unit tests, integration tests, and snapshots.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Testing Methods">

<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Unit Tests
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-26-2019-unit-test-aws-infrastructure#unit-test">unit test</a>
is an assertion that a unit of code is working as expected. Units of code can range from a single line
or function to an entire class or application.  Unit tests are often run in isolation, without impact
from external dependencies.  In React, units are often methods or shallow rendered components (components
rendered without their child components).
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Integration Tests
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
In an integration test, units of code are combined and tested together as a group.  The grouping of code
can range from two functions to an entire webpage or application.  In React, this grouping is often a
module or a component rendered on the DOM with its child components.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Snapshot Tests
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A snapshot test takes a snapshot of the UI and saves it.  On subsequent snapshot tests, the saved snapshot
is compared to the current UI.  If the UI changed since the snapshot was taken, the test fails.  Snapshot
tests are very helpful in preventing unwanted UI changes<sup>3</sup>.  In React, snapshots are created
for components.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<SectionTitle title="Unit Tests">Unit Tests</SectionTitle>
<p>
Unit tests assert that a unit of code behaves as expected.  When writing unit tests, we use three main
functions provided by Jest - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">describe()</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">it()</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">assert()</code>.
These functions aren’t explicitly imported into test code, Jest injects them implicitly when the tests execute.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">describe()</code> creates a grouping of test cases (test suite)
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">it()</code> creates a single test case.  Test cases pass if
all their assertions (created with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">assert()</code> and a
corresponding <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect">matcher</a>) are true.  Test cases fail as
soon as a single assertion fails.  Matchers are chained onto <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
assert()</code> global functions.  Some examples of matchers are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
toEqual()</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">toBeTruthy()</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">toContain()</code>.
</p>
<p>
A common "Hello World" unit test example adds two values together and asserts the result is a third value.
I created this <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2020/02-Feb/
02-05-react-jest-enzyme">test application</a>, which is easily executed with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">npm install</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
npm run test</code>.  Here is the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/
master/2020/02-Feb/02-05-react-jest-enzyme/test.js">Jest code</a>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
describe('unit tests', () => {

  it('adds two numbers', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
  });

});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code creates a single test case named "adds two numbers" in a single test suite named "unit test."
It also successfully proves that <strong>1 + 1 = 2</strong>.  Running this code with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">npm run test</code> produces the following output:
</p>

<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/2-5-20-jest-output.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The next piece needed for React unit tests is Enzyme.  I previously mentioned that React component unit
tests are implemented with shallow rendering.  Shallow rendering only renders the React elements in a
components render method (or return value for functional components), not any child components.  Enzyme
provides shallow rendering with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">shallow()</code> method.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">shallow()</code> takes a component as an argument and returns a
wrapper around the rendered component with helper methods used for testing<sup>4</sup>.  The following
unit test performs a shallow render, proving that the component successfully renders.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import App from '../src/App';

it('renders', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(&lt;App/>);
  expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In this example the wrappers <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exists()</code> method is called,
which returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code> if the wrapper’s rendered component
contains one or more elements (nodes)<sup>5</sup>.  On the Jest side of things,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">wrapper.exists()</code> was expected to be
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>.
</p>
<p>
The wrapper object returned from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">shallow()</code> has an
<a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html">extensive API</a> that satisfies most testing
needs.  Shallow rendering often falls short of testing requirements when DOM API logic needs to be tested.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">shallow()</code> doesn’t simulate rendering on the DOM, so none
of its APIs are accessible from the wrapper object.  To test components interactions with the DOM they
must be fully rendered with Enzyme’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mount()</code> function.
Full DOM rendering falls under integration tests, which I will cover in the next section.
</p>
<p>
A common unit test for components is to assert that certain text or classes appear in the rendered elements.
These tests can also be fulfilled by snapshots depending on your personal preference.  The following test
traverses the rendered nodes in a component and asserts that the rendered text is as expected.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
it('renders message', () => {
const wrapper = shallow(&lt;DerivedFromPropsRefactored show={true} />);
  expect(wrapper.find('.secret-code')).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(wrapper.find('.secret-code-classified')).toHaveLength(0);
  expect(wrapper.find('.secret-code').childAt(0).text()).toEqual('You have a beautiful heart.');
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are many other unit tests that can be performed on React components.  When I first started using
Enzyme, familiarizing myself with the <a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html">shallow
render wrapper functions</a> was crucial to writing quality unit tests.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Integration Tests">Integration Tests</SectionTitle>
<p>
Integration tests occur when units of code are combined and tested together as a group.  Integration
tests build upon the Jest and Enzyme fundamentals used for unit testing.  In this section I’ll show
some interesting tests from my React 16.3 application.  I encourage you to check out and adjust my tests
on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/tree/master/app/test">GitHub</a> to your
specific needs.
</p>
<p>
Integration tests are performed on React components using Enzyme’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
mount()</code> method.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mount()</code> simulates a full DOM
rendering with access to the DOM API.  With that in mind, integration tests are useful for code that
accesses the DOM API.  In React, Refs serve this purpose.  The following test checks if the CSS style
attached to a DOM node changes after a button is clicked.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import { shallow, mount } from 'enzyme';
import RefSamples from '../../src/createref/RefSamples';

it('lights up a light bulb on focus', () => {
  const wrapper = mount(&lt;RefSamples />);

  const button = wrapper.find('.aj-outlined-button');
  const lightBulb = wrapper.find('.ref-sample');

  // The initial filter value will be empty instead of 'brightness(4)' as defined in my CSS file
  // because Jest/Enzyme don't load CSS stylesheets.
  expect(lightBulb.getDOMNode().style.filter).toEqual('');

  button.simulate('click');

  // Alternative way to get the style value through the DOM API.
  expect(lightBulb.getDOMNode().style.getPropertyValue('filter'))
    .toEqual('brightness(5)');
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Enzyme provides access into the DOM node of a React element with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getDomNone()</code> method<sup>6</sup>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">style.filer</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">style.getPropertyValue()</code> are part of the DOM API, not React
or Enzyme.
</p>
<p>
This example also demonstrates another important feature of React integration tests - event simulation.
If React code handles or responds to DOM events like <code className="jarombek-inline-code">onClick</code>,
integration tests are needed to hook into the DOM API.  I used Enzyme’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
simulate(event)</code> function to simulate clicking a button.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to learn more about React Refs and this integration test, you can view the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/tree/master/app/src">React source code</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/tree/master/app/test">unit test code</a>, and my
<a href="https://react16-3.demo.jarombek.com/">React 16.3</a> demo which explains the use of Refs.
</p>
<p>
A common practice in unit tests is mocking.  Mocking is when a function or external dependency is replaced
with something that imitates its behavior.  Mocking helps isolate unit tests from the side effects of
code dependencies.  For example, a function that makes a REST API call can be mocked to simply return an object.
</p>
<p>
In my React 16.3 application, I needed to mock the behavior or React Router navigation.  React Router
navigates users to different web pages by placing a new value in the browser history.  For example,
from a home page (<strong>jarombek.com</strong>) React Router can push a new value
(<strong>jarombek.com/resume</strong>) to the browser history, navigating the user to a page displaying
my resume in the process.  My application uses React Router’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
useHistory()</code> hook method to provide navigation.  The code to test its behavior mocks
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">useHistory()</code> with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
jest.mock()</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import { shallow, mount } from 'enzyme';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import FeaturePage from '../src/FeaturePage';

// Mock react router's useHistory() hook before the tests execute.
jest.mock('react-router-dom', () => {
  const historyObj = {
    push: jest.fn()
  };

  return {
    ...jest.requireActual('react-router-dom'),
    useHistory: () => historyObj
  }
});

describe('integration tests', () => {

  it('calls React Router push() when clicking the back button', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(&lt;FeaturePage/>);
    const pushSpy = jest.spyOn(useHistory(), 'push').mockImplementation();

    const navCircle = wrapper.find('.aj-nav-circle');

    expect(pushSpy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(pushSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);

    navCircle.simulate('click');

    expect(pushSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(pushSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(pushSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/');
  });

});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can see this code mocked the entire <code className="jarombek-inline-code">react-router-dom</code>
module, and inside it also mocked <code className="jarombek-inline-code">useHistory</code> with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">jest.fn()</code>.  In the integration test, I spied on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">useHistory</code> function, which provides information such
as the number of times its been called and with which arguments<sup>7</sup>.  This test proves that
clicking on a navigation button pushes the home page path (<strong>'/'</strong>) onto the browser history.
</p>
<p>
I’m still learning how to use mocks and spies in Jest, so the code above can likely be improved further!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Snapshot Tests">Snapshot Tests</SectionTitle>
<p>
In my experience, snapshot tests are much simpler than unit tests and integration tests.  The job of a
snapshot test is to pass if the rendered component matches the existing snapshot, or fail if the rendered
component changed since the existing snapshot was taken.
</p>
<p>
The first step in implementing snapshot tests is to create the test case.  The following snapshot test is
for a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/test/forwardref/
ButtonWrapper.snap.test.js">button component</a> used in my React 16.3 demo,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ButtonWrapper</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import React from 'react';
import ButtonWrapper from '../../src/ButtonWrapper';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(&lt;ButtonWrapper>Snapshot Test&lt;/ButtonWrapper>).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When running the snapshot test for the first time, a snapshot file is created with the rendered elements
as they would appear on the React virtual DOM.  For example, <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/src/forwardref/ButtonWrapper.js"><code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ButtonWrapper</code></a> is a functional component:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const ButtonWrapper = (props) => {
  const {children, onClick, ref} = props;

  return (
    &lt;button className="button-wrapper" type="button" onClick={onClick} ref={ref}>
      {children}
    &lt;/button>
  );
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When the snapshot test for <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ButtonWrapper</code> runs, the following
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo/blob/master/app/test/forwardref/__snapshots__/
ButtonWrapper.snap.test.js.snap">snapshot file</a> is generated:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
  &lt;button
    className="button-wrapper"
    type="button"
  >
    Snapshot Test
  &lt;/button>
`;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All future tests don’t overwrite the snapshot file, instead comparing the result of the snapshot test to
it.  If the snapshots mismatch, the test fails.
</p>
<p>
There are two main scenarios that cause a snapshot test to fail.  One scenario is when the component under
test was incorrectly modified, causing the UI to change.  In this scenario, the course of action is to
fix the component causing the failure.  Another scenario is when the component was intentionally modified
and the UI is expected to change.  In this scenario, the snapshot files should be updated to match the
new UI rendering.  This is achieved by executing <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
jest --updateSnapshot</code> from the command line.
</p>
<p>
I’ve only found snapshots helpful when the developer or team makes it a point of emphasis to validate
snapshots before releasing new code.  Otherwise, snapshot files will always be out of date and worthless
for testing purposes.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Used together, unit, integration, and snapshot tests help detect regressions and bugs in a React codebase.
They ensure that all UI changes released are intentional, not due to an unwanted side effect.  I use
Jest and Enzyme in all my React applications.  You can view my React 16.3 test suite on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/react-16-3-demo">GitHub</a>.

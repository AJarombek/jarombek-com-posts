In my new role at work, a good chunk of my programming is Python based and revolves around data
analysis.  I already knew Python, however I wanted a review libraries such as numpy and
 learn libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.  This article discusses numpy, short for
"Numerical Python".  The goal of this article isn't to teach numpy to beginners, instead focusing on
 library aspects I found most interesting.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is Numpy">What is Numpy?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Numpy is a library used for data analysis and scientific computing.  At its most basic level, numpy
exposes an API for working with arrays of one or more dimensions.  Numpy is often used in conjunction
with higher-level libraries such as pandas, which builds upon numpy arrays.
</p>
<p>
A single-dimension numpy array containing the numbers 1 through 3 is created with the following code:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Since Python already has native lists, the typical question to ask is what benefits numpy arrays provide.
First, numpy arrays are fast.  Numpy stores its arrays in a separate storage location from other Python
objects and avoids certain overheads found in all Python objects<sup>1</sup>.  Its lower level C
implementation helps facilitate extremely fast array manipulation and analysis.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, numpy's API is superior to the native Python list implementation.  Simple array
operations are performed in a more concise manner, and advanced commands exist that are
challenging to implement in the Python list API.  One of the simple features that shows the power of numpy is
vectorization.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Vectorization">Vectorization</SectionTitle>
<p>
Numpy arrays provide <strong>vectorization</strong> abilities.  Vectorization in numpy is when operations
are applied to entire arrays instead of individual items within a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop<sup>2</sup>.  Instead of writing a
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop for numpy arrays in Python code, the underlying numpy API uses a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code>
loop in its C implementation, which is much faster than native Python.  As a simple vectorization example,
let's take a numpy array and multiply each element by two.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
arr = np.arange(10)
arr

# Out[1]: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

arr * 2

# Out[2]: array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The output above is what you would see when running the code in a
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>.  The initial <code className="jarombek-inline-code">arange()</code>
function creates an array of length 10 from 0 to 9.  Next, a vectorization operation is performed.  Each item in the array
is multiplied by two.  An equivalent Python list operation would use a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> loop.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
native_arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

def mult_by_2(arr: list, val: int) -> list:
  new_arr = arr.copy()

  for i in range(len(new_arr)):
    new_arr[i] *= val

  return new_arr

mult_by_2(native_arr, 2)

# Out[3]: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Vectorization operations on numpy arrays don't mutate the original array, instead creating a new array
instance.  Therefore, my native Python implementation first makes a copy of the existing list before
making changes.
</p>
<p>
The numpy vectorization I wrote applied a multiplication operator (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">*</code>)
with a scalar value (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">2</code>) to an array.  Vectorization
operators can also apply an operator with an array to an equally sized array<sup>4</sup>.  For example,
the following code multiplies the items in each array with each other.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
arr * arr

# Out[4]: array([ 0,  1,  4,  9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Once again, this would be more difficult to write with native Python lists.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def mult_together(arr1: list, arr2: list) -> list:
  return [arr1[i] * arr2[i] for i in range(len(arr1))]

mult_together(native_arr, native_arr)

# Out[5]: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I made the implementation a bit shorter with a list comprehension, however it still isn't as elegant as
the numpy solution.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Broadcasting">Broadcasting</SectionTitle>
<p>
Related to vectorization, <strong>broadcasting</strong> is when vectorization operators are performed
on two arrays of different sizes.  Technically my first example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">arr * 2</code>,
is an example of broadcasting an array of length N to an array of length 1<sup>5</sup>.  Numpy has
certain rules for how broadcasting works between two arrays<sup>6</sup>.  Two arrays are eligible for
broadcasting if:
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Broadcasting Rules">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Equal Dimensions
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The dimension values for both arrays are equal.  For example, an array of dimension <strong>2 x 3</strong> and
another array of dimension <strong>2 x 3</strong> are eligible for broadcasting.  Likewise, an array of
dimension <strong>2 x 3 x 4</strong> and another array of dimension <strong>3 x 4</strong> are eligible
for broadcasting.  However, an array of dimension <strong>2 x 3</strong> and another array of dimension
<strong>3 x 2</strong> are not eligible for broadcasting.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Single Dimension Equal to One
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The dimension value in one array is greater than one while the other is equal to one.  For example, an
array of dimension 2 x 3 and another array of dimension 2 x 1 are eligible for broadcasting.  Likewise,
an array of dimension 2 x 3 x 4 and another array of dimension 1 x 4 are eligible for broadcasting.
</p>

Here are broadcasting results from the five scenarios I mentioned in my comparison table above:

<SectionTitle title="Ease of Creating Arrays">Ease of Creating Arrays</SectionTitle>
<p>
Creation of lists in Python is straightforward yet limited in options.  More complex list creation can
be accomplished with list comprehensions, as shown in the section on vectorization.  Still, even list
comprehensions aren't as powerful as the API numpy exposes for array creation.
</p>
<p>
A good example is a reshaped numpy array.  In comparison to a Python list created with a list comprehension,
 the numpy <code className="jarombek-inline-code">reshape()</code> method is more explicit in describing what it accomplishes.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
np.arange(0, 23, 2).reshape(3, 4)

<SectionTitle title="Enhanced Slicing">Enhanced Slicing</SectionTitle>
<p>
Python lists already provide pretty nice slicing capabilities.  Numpy takes slicing to another level.
Numpy extends the indexing and slicing syntax in Python single-dimension lists for use in
multi-dimensional arrays.  The following examples demonstrate multi-dimensional indexing and slicing.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Unlike Python lists, numpy array indexes accept comma separated values.
# Each value is a slice for a dimension of the array.
arr = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
arr[1, 1]

# Out[12]: 4

arr[:, :]

# Out[13]: array([[0, 1, 2],
#                 [3, 4, 5],
#                 [6, 7, 8]])

arr[1:, :1]

# Out[14]: array([[3],
#                 [6]])

arr[:, 2]

# Out[15]: array([2, 5, 8])

arr[:, 2] = 10
arr

# Out[16]: array([[ 0,  1, 10],
#                 [ 3,  4, 10],
#                 [ 6,  7, 10]])

<p>
Numpy indexing and slicing operations can contain conditional logic.  Here are some more advanced
indexing and slicing operations on the same numpy array instance.

Reshaping numpy arrays is easy with a variety of functions for altering data arrangements.  Some
of the basic ones include <code className="jarombek-inline-code">reshape(shape)</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">flatten()</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">T</code>
(short for transpose).

<SectionTitle title="Custom Functions">Custom Functions</SectionTitle>
<p>
While vectorization and built-in numpy functions are extremely helpful when transforming numpy arrays,
sometimes they aren't flexible enough for our needs.  In this case, custom functions can be created.
For example, I created the following function which converts miles to kilometers:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
# Custom functions can be created with frompyfunc().  Note that these functions take a performance hit
# compared to their numpy counterparts.  There is a way to speed up custom functions to numpy-like performance
# with the numba library.
def miles_to_kilometers(miles):
  return miles * 1.609

# Create a custom unary ufunc (takes a single argument) that converts miles to kilometers
mile2km = np.frompyfunc(miles_to_kilometers, 1, 1)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This function can be applied to each item in an array.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
arr = np.array([1, 3, 5])
mile2km(arr)

# Out[29]: array([1.609, 4.827, 8.045])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Unfortunately, this custom function is very slow.  The following test shows the time taken by
the custom function versus vectorization.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
%timeit mile2km(arr)

# Out[30]: 6.75 µs ± 107 ns per loop

%timeit arr * 1.609

# Out[31]: 1.04 µs ± 11.3 ns per loop
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The performance problem is that custom functions live in Python instead of C, with the latter being much faster.
Luckily it is possible to write fast custom numpy functions using a library called <strong>numba</strong>.
Numba uses LLVM to convert Python code to assembly code<sup>7</sup>.  The mile to kilometer function
is easily rewritten with numba.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
@nb.jit
def miles_to_kilometers(miles):
  return miles * 1.609

arr = np.array([1, 3, 5])
miles_to_kilometers(arr)

# Out[32]: array([1.609, 4.827, 8.045])
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The numba function is extremely fast!  In fact, numba functions are often faster than
their numpy vectorization counterparts.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
%timeit miles_to_kilometers(np.arange(100))

# Out[33]: 1.18 µs ± 13.9 ns per loop

%timeit np.arange(100) * 1.609

# Out[34]: 1.89 µs ± 53.2 ns per loop

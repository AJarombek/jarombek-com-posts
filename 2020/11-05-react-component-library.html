Front-end applications, specifically those created with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=React&page=1">React</a>,
are built with small reusable JavaScript functions called <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-31-2018-react-seed#react-component">
components</a>.  Each component renders and handles the business logic for a small chunk of the application.  Components
have props, state, and elements that render on the screen.

When working on multiple React applications or being part of an organization, it's beneficial to create a reusable
component library.  This library is shared amongst applications and contains generic components such as buttons,
accordions, and form elements.  Besides the obvious benefit of code reuse, component libraries help to enforce
organizational style guides and allow developers to easily iterate on components used in all their applications.  Setup
of a component library is easy and can save a lot of front-end development time in the long run.

The directory structure shown above matches the one for my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-react-components">
reusable component library</a>.  There are three top level directories.  <strong>.storybook</strong> holds configuration
for <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">storybook</a>, a visualization tool for components.  I use storybook to both view
and test the functionality of my reusable components.  <strong>components</strong> holds the React component source code,
tests, and storybook stories.  Storybook stories display and document a component.  <strong>dist</strong> is the bundled
and minimized code of the reusable component library.  This code is used by applications that utilize the component
library.

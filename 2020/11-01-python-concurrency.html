Parallelism, multithreading, multi-process programming, and asynchronous programming; Concepts dealing with concurrency
are often the most difficult to learn when learning a new programming language.  There are often many different
approaches available and it’s hard to know the best approach (look no further than <strong>Java: Concurrency in
Practice</strong>, a 350 page book on writing proper concurrency code in Java).  Python is no different, with multiple
evolving libraries, and, for added confusion, a global interpreter lock (GIL) which restricts Python code to a single
thread when running on its default CPython interpreter.  In this article, I attempt to demystify concurrent
programming in Python and work with libraries such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">concurrent.futures</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">asyncio</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aiohttp</code>.

Ironically, the best place to start learning how concurrency works is to analyze non-concurrent, sequential code.
Sequential code executes one task (instruction) after another.  Each sequential program runs as a single process, which
is an instance of a computer program.  In theory, a process running sequential code executes in its entirety on a
single core of a CPU without giving up control and allowing other processes to run concurrently (during the same time
period).  In reality, the operating system managing computer processes will likely perform context switches during a
program's execution, allowing other processes to use the CPU concurrently<sup>1</sup>.  For the purposes of this
article I won’t focus on the operating system level concurrency of our processes, just the code written in our program.

<p>
The following Python code performs API requests that are executed sequentially.  It makes an HTTP call to the API, waits
for a response, processes the response, and then makes the next API call.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import time

import requests

domain = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/'
endpoints = ['posts', 'comments', 'albums', 'photos', 'todos', 'users']


def make_requests():
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        url = f'{domain}{endpoint}'
        print(url)
        response = requests.get(url)
        print(response.status_code)


def main():
    start = time.time()
    make_requests()
    end = time.time()
    print(f'API calls made in: {end - start}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are a few issues with this approach.  The most glaring problem being that time is wasted while the program awaits a
response from the API.  Since the API call is a network I/O task to a remote server (potentially located thousands of
miles away), the response could take anywhere from milliseconds to minutes.  Either way, that is a lot of time that
could be spent executing other tasks, such as another API call.
</p>
<p>
A better approach is to utilize concurrency, which Python provides multiple ways to achieve.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Python Concurrency">Python Concurrency</SectionTitle>
<p>
Concurrent programming is when multiple computations are executed during the same time period<sup>2</sup>.  Programs
running concurrently are sometimes also running in parallel, but not always.  Programs running in parallel are
executing at the same time, either on separate CPUs or on different cores of a single CPU.  Programs written to
utilize parallelism can also be described as running concurrently (just not necessarily vice-versa).
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Concurrency vs. Parallelism">

Concurrency
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
In programming, concurrency is when two or more programs are executing during the same time period.  In a single CPU
architecture these programs share the CPU, so their executions are interleaved.  For example, program A runs for
one second, then gives up the CPU to program B, which runs for two seconds.  In a multiprocessor or multi-core
architecture, these processes can run in parallel.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that concurrency does not imply parallelism.  Computers are able to give the illusion that
multiple programs are running simultaneously (in parallel) on the CPU without actually doing so.  This is achieved with
time sharing and context switching.  On architectures with a single CPU and single core it is simply impossible to
perform tasks in parallel.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Parallelism
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
In programming, parallel computing is when two or more programs are executing simultaneously.  For example, program A
and program B start at the same time on different processors, with program A completing in one second and program B
completing in two seconds.  Computer programs can spawn additional processes or threads which can run in parallel on a
separate processor from the main process/thread.
</p>
<p>
By definition, computations which run in parallel are also run concurrently.  Parallel processing is hardware dependent.
Therefore, software with separate threads or processes designed to run on separate processors don't
necessarily do so.  If a computer's hardware is limited to a single CPU or core, these threads and
processes will simply run concurrently on the same processor.

With the concepts of concurrency and parallelism in mind, I began refactoring the Python code which makes API calls.
Python provides a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">concurrency.futures</code> library, which allows computations
to be executed asynchronously using either threads or processes.
</p>
<Definition word="Asynchronous Programming">
<p>
Asynchronous programming is a form of concurrent programming that awaits events in a non-blocking fashion.  In other
words, asynchronous code allows other pieces of code to execute concurrently (and potentially in parallel) while it
awaits external events to occur (such as API calls, filesystem I/O events, mouse clicks, long mathematical computations,
etc.).  Many high-level programming languages have built-in support for asynchronous programming.
</p>
</Definition>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">concurrency.futures</code> contains a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ThreadPoolExecutor</code> class which can run asynchronous tasks in separate threads (although with limitations - because
of CPython’s Global Interpreter Lock [GIL] - which I will explain in a second).  Using
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ThreadPoolExecutor</code> can significantly speed up the sequential API calls
I wrote previously.

<p>
This code creates a thread pool with five workers, so that five API calls can be made concurrently.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, the CPython interpreter has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).  The GIL allows only a single thread to run
Python bytecode at a time, meaning that Python code is able to create multiple threads, but not run them in
parallel<sup>3</sup>.  A thread will acquire the lock when it wants to run Python code, and release it once it completes.
Therefore, when using the default CPython interpreter, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ThreadPoolExecutor</code>
class can be a bit misleading.  Due to the GIL, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ThreadPoolExecutor</code>
example runs concurrently but not in parallel.
</p>
<Definition word="Thread">
<p>
A thread, also known as a lightweight process, is the most basic unit of scheduling in most computers<sup>4</sup>.  A
computer process is initially created with a single thread of execution, known as the main thread.  Main threads have
the ability to split and create one or more additional threads.  A thread can be thought of as a subset of a
process<sup>5</sup>.  Threads share the memory space of their parent process, which is both beneficial and dangerous when
writing multithreaded programs.  The benefit is that variables which are global to the process can be utilized by all
threads. The danger is there can be race conditions when multiple threads are accessing and modifying values in their
shared memory space.
</p>
</Definition>
<p>
For I/O bound tasks like making API calls, using asynchronous programming approaches like
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ThreadPoolExecutor</code> can still speed up the code<sup>6</sup>.  This is
because while the asynchronous call is awaiting an event, it releases the GIL.  Therefore other threads can run Python
code by acquiring the GIL.  This allows API calls made with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ThreadPoolExecutor</code>
to run faster than sequential code.  Unfortunately for CPU-bound programs, using multiple threads does not speed up
execution times.
</p>
<p>
Python does provide a way to optimize CPU-bound tasks.  Instead of creating multiple threads and running tasks in each,
multiple processes can be created.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">concurrency.futures</code> has a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ProcessPoolExecutor</code> class which provides this functionality.  The API code
can be rewritten again to use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ProcessPoolExecutor</code> (note: using processes
instead of threads is less useful for I/O-bound tasks like API calls).

Python provides many libraries for asynchronous programming, but one of the newer and more significant libraries is

<p>
With <strong>asyncio</strong>, the keywords <code className="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">await</code> can be used.  <strong>asyncio</strong> is a high-level library,
abstracting away implementation details (such as its usage of coroutines).  This design decision makes it easy to use and a
preferred way to implement asynchronous programs.

<p>
A Python coroutine is a function defined with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">async def</code> keywords.
Coroutines can be suspended and restarted many times throughout their lifecycle, making them ideal for asynchronous
programming<sup>7</sup>.  They can also receive data and return data throughout their lifecycle.

<strong>asyncio</strong> is a massive library and deserves its own article, but the following code snippet demonstrates
the basics.

There are a vast number of libraries available in Python to help with concurrency and parallelism.  Many of the
lower-level classes that Python provides (including <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Thread</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Task</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Semaphore</code>) were
omitted from this article in favor of higher-level libraries.  While going over everything related to concurrency in Python
 requires a multi-hundred page book, in this article I explored how certain concurrent programming terminologies can
translate into Python code.  The full code for this article is available on

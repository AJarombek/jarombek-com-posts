From October 2018 to May 2019, I converted moved the infrastructure for both my websites to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a>.   The process for building and tearing
down this infrastructure is automated with IaC, specifically <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog?query=terraform&page=1">Terraform</a>.  I’ve had a lot of fun working with Terraform and learning
the different design patterns for infrastructure in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
After my infrastructure was built, I realized I needed a way to test that my IaC was behaving as
expected.  The obvious solution to this requirement was to build a unit test suite.  I implemented
this unit test suite in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=python&page=1">Python</a> with the
help of the AWS SDK.  This article first explains why I took the time to write unit tests, followed
by a walkthrough the basics of testing AWS infrastructure in Python.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Why Build Unit Tests">Why Build Unit Tests?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Over the three and a half years I’ve been a software engineer, I’ve slowly realized how valuable unit
tests are.  In my early applications, unit tests were noticeably absent.  Unit tests finally started
appearing in my repositories this spring.  I made it mandatory for new applications to have full unit
test coverage and began adding tests to older applications still being maintained.
</p>
<Definition word="Unit Test">
A Unit Test is an assertion that a unit of code is working as expected<sup>1</sup>.  Units of code
can be a single line, a function, a class, or an application.  Unit tests are run on a regular basis.
This includes (but is not limited to) code commits, application deployments, and scheduled intervals.
</Definition>
<p>
There are three main reasons why I hopped on the unit test bandwagon.  The first reason is that writing
unit tests helps catch poorly written or useless code.  When I write code, my brain tends to wander and
get sidetracked.  Often I write a section of code over the course of days or weeks.  I usually don’t
have the time to go back through every line of code and make sure its well written or still being used.
However, when I write unit tests and have to formulate test scenarios for every line of a program, smelly
code becomes easy to identify.
</p>
<p>
The second reason is that unit tests help catch recurring bugs before they make it into a production build.
A good practice is to create a unit test every time a bug is found in an application.  Writing tests for
a bug helps developers learn their root cause and provides quick detection for their return in the future.
</p>
<p>
The third reason is that unit tests ease the pain of upgrading technology versions in an application,
whether it be a language, framework, or library.  Unit tests give us peace of mind that all the corners of
our application are still functional after software upgrades occur.
</p>
<p>
I firmly believe the upfront costs of building unit tests are worthwhile in the long run.

<SectionTitle title="Unit Testing AWS Infrastructure">Unit Testing AWS Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
I wrote unit tests for my Terraform infrastructure using Python and the <strong>boto3</strong> AWS SDK.
I took two separate approaches to setting up these unit tests.  For my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
global-aws-infrastructure">global</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">
SaintsXCTF</a> AWS infrastructure, I reinvented the wheel and created custom test suites.  By the time I
wrote my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-infrastructure">jarombek.com</a> infrastructure,
I figured there must be a better approach.  I decided to scrap the custom test suite and used Python’s
built-in <strong>unittest</strong> library instead.  I’ll demonstrate both approaches next, followed by
some unit test function examples.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Custom Approach">Custom Approach</SectionTitle>
<p>
My first approach to unit testing infrastructure involved reinventing the wheel in regards to building a
test suite.  I first defined an entrypoint to the unit tests.  Executing a single <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/test/src/masterTestSuite.py">Python file</a> runs all
the unit tests I wrote:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import masterTestFuncs as Test
from bastion import bastionTestSuite as Bastion
from acm import acmTestSuite as ACM
from databases import databaseTestSuite as Database
from iam import iamTestSuite as IAM
from route53 import route53TestSuite as Route53
from webserver import webserverTestSuite as WebServer

# List of all the test suites
tests = [
  Bastion.bastion_test_suite,
  ACM.acm_test_suite,
  Database.database_test_suite,
  IAM.iam_test_suite,
  Route53.route53_test_suite,
  WebServer.webserver_test_suite
]

# Create and execute a master test suite
Test.testsuite(tests, "Master Test Suite")
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This entrypoint file is referred to as the “master test suite.”  The master test suite invokes child test
suites which are grouped by AWS resource type.  For example, all my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/test/src/acm/acmTestSuite.py">ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
infrastructure tests</a> are found in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">acmTestSuite</code> and are
invoked by calling <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ACM.acm_test_suite</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import masterTestFuncs as Test
from acm import acmTestFuncs as Func

tests = [
  lambda: Test.test(Func.acm_dev_wildcard_cert_issued, "ACM SaintsXCTF Dev Wildcard Certificate Issued"),
  lambda: Test.test(Func.acm_wildcard_cert_issued, "ACM SaintsXCTF Wildcard Certificate Issued"),
  lambda: Test.test(Func.acm_cert_issued, "ACM SaintsXCTF Certificate Issued")
]


def acm_test_suite() -> bool:
  """
  Execute all the tests related to the ACM HTTPS certificates
  :return: True if the tests succeed, False otherwise
  """
  return Test.testsuite(tests, "ACM Test Suite")
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the master test suite and ACM test suite have the same structure.  Both test suites contain
a list of unit tests and a function which executes the tests.  The main difference is that the master test
suite executes a list of <strong>test suites</strong> while the ACM test suite executes a list of
<strong>unit tests</strong>.  Test suites are executed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Test.testsuite()</code> function and unit tests are executed with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Test.test()</code> function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
def testsuite(tests: list, title: str) -> bool:
  """
  Wrapper function to execute any number of logically grouped tests
  :param tests: a list of tests to execute
  :param title: description of the test suite
  :return: True if the test suite succeeds, false otherwise
  """
  print(f"\u293F Executing Test Suite: {title}")

  success = 0
  failure = 0

  for test_func in tests:
    if test_func():
      success += 1
    else:
      failure += 1

  suitepassed = failure < 1

  if suitepassed:
    print(f"\u2713 Test Suite Success: {title} ({success} passed, {failure} failed)")
  else:
    print(f"\u274C Test Suite Failure: {title} ({success} passed, {failure} failed)")

  return suitepassed


def test(func: Callable[[], Any], title: str) -> bool:
  """
  Wrapper function for testing an AWS resource
  :param func: a function to execute, must return a boolean value
  :param title: describes the test
  :return: True if the test succeeds, false otherwise
  """

  result = func()

  if result:
    print(f"\u2713 Success: {title}")
    return True
  else:
    print(f"\u274C Failure: {title}")
    return False
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
A nice aspect of my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/test/src/
masterTestFuncs.py">custom approach</a> is that a child test suite can be run as if it's the master test suite.  In this scenario, only the tests within the child test suite will execute.
</p>
<p>
However, reinventing the unit test wheel didn’t add much value to my tests.  Therefore, I decided to try
a different approach for my <strong>jarombek.com</strong> infrastructure tests.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="unittest Approach">unittest Approach</SectionTitle>
<p>
My second approach to unit testing infrastructure involved the built-in Python <strong>unittest</strong>
framework.  <strong>unittest</strong> has an additional component called a test runner.  The test runner
orchestrates test suites and the execution of unit tests inside them<sup>2</sup>.  My <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/jarombek-com-infrastructure/blob/master/test/src/runner.py">test runner</a> is configured to
execute all the test suites.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import unittest
import suites.acm as acm
import suites.iam as iam
import suites.route53 as route53
import suites.jarombekCom as jarombekCom
import suites.jarombekComAssets as jarombekComAssets

# Create the test suite
loader = unittest.TestLoader()
suite = unittest.TestSuite()

# Add test files to the test suite
suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(acm))
suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(iam))
suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(route53))
suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(jarombekCom))
suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(jarombekComAssets))

# Create a test runner and execute the test suite
runner = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=3)
result = runner.run(suite)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In <strong>unittest</strong>, test suites are subclasses of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TestCase</code>.   <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TestCase</code> provides assertion methods, setup and teardown methods, and test execution methods<sup>3</sup>.  The following class is a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-infrastructure/blob/master/test/src/suites/acm.py">test suite for ACM infrastructure tests</a>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
import unittest
import boto3


class TestACM(unittest.TestCase):

  def setUp(self) -> None:
    """
    Perform set-up logic before executing any unit tests
    """
    self.acm = boto3.client('acm')
    self.acm_certificates = self.acm.list_certificates(CertificateStatuses=['ISSUED'])

  def test_dev_wildcard_cert_issued(self) -> None:
    pass

  def test_wildcard_cert_issued(self) -> None:
    pass
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With <strong>unittest</strong>, much of the test suite setup code necessary in my custom approach is
handled by the test framework.  This allows me to spend more time working on the unit tests themselves.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Unit Test Examples">Unit Test Examples</SectionTitle>

<p>
If I could start my infrastructure unit tests over from scratch, I would write them all with the
<strong>unittest</strong> framework.  I believe that developers should only reinvent the wheel under two
scenarios - as a learning experience or if they think they can improve the existing technology.  While it
was a good learning experience creating a unit test suite from scratch, it was very barebones functionality
wise.  Because of this, it didn’t assist me in learning the underworkings of test frameworks such as
<strong>unittest</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I should’ve spent more time exploring the different approaches to Python unit tests before jumping into
a custom solution.  There a many different unit testing frameworks for each programming language, and I
will make sure to explore all my options before choosing one in future projects.

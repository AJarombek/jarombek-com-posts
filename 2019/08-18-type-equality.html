In this article I'm revisiting the concept of type equality.  Type equality is a topic that software engineers 
learn early on in their careers.  Similar to any other profession, it's beneficial to go
back to the basics for practice.  Professional basketball players practice layups before each game.
Professional programmers should work at the basics as well.  I spent this past week re-learning type
equality in 13 different languages.  In the process I've reaffirmed my knowledge and gained new insights.  The rest
of this article discusses my findings.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="The Different Forms of Type Equality">The Different Forms of Type Equality</SectionTitle>
<p>
Each programming language has its own intricacies in regards to analysing types for equality.
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#type">Types</a> are the blueprints
for values in programming languages.  Types define the characteristics of a value and differentiates a
value from other types<sup>1</sup>.  Equality is a test to see if two values are equal.  There are two
main forms of equality - reference equality and value equality.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Forms of Equality">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Reference Equality
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Tests for reference equality check to see if two variables, primitives, or objects refer to the
same space in memory.  When two variables are referentially equal, altering the value of one impacts the other
since they refer to the same bytes in memory.  For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
var a = "value"</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">var b = a</code> results in two variables
  that point to the same memory location in many languages.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Value Equality
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Tests for value equality check to see if two variables, primitives, or objects are logically the same.
For example, two integers containing the value <code className="jarombek-inline-code">2</code> are deemed
 equal in value, since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">2 = 2</code>.  Another example is
two objects <code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code>
where the properties in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">a</code> have the same values assigned to
them as the properties in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">b</code>.  These two objects would
pass a value equality check.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
In many languages value equality is dependent on the two values conforming to the same type.  However,
some languages lift this restriction in certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Languages that allow values of different types to be equal are generally considered loosely typed.  Languages
where it's impossible or very rare for values of different types to be equal are generally considered
strongly typed.  Loosely typed and strongly typed languages should not be confused for
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#dynamic-&-static-typing">dynamically
and statically typed languages</a>.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Type Rules">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Loosely Typed
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A language that is loosely typed (weakly typed) is one where type rules are not as strict.  In a
loosely typed language types can often be converted to other types implicitly.  This is known as
implicit type coercion, since a type can be coerced to another type.  For example, in PHP
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">2 == '2'</code> returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>
because the string <code className="jarombek-inline-code">'2'</code> is implicitly converted to a number
before the type equality check is made.  Languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and PowerShell are
generally considered loosely typed languages.  However, there is no clear boundary between a loosely
typed language and a strongly typed language.  It's mostly up to personal interpretation which category
the language belongs in.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Strongly Typed
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
A language that is strongly typed has very strict type rules.  In order for a type to be converted
to another type, an explicit conversion mechanism must be visible in the code.  For example, Java is
a strongly typed language where explicit casts are used to convert from one type to another, such as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">double two = 2.0</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
int twoInt = (int) two;</code>.  However, there are still a few cases in Java where implicit type
coercion occurs, such as converting an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">int</code> to a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">double</code> or boxing and un-boxing primitives.  Languages such
as C, Java, and Python are generally considered strongly typed.  Just like loosely typed languages,
there is no explicit rule for whether or not a language is strongly typed.  It's mostly up to personal
interpretation of the language.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
Now let's explore equality in the programming languages I use.  Look out for the different ways each
language handles reference and value equality.  In terms of value equality, watch out for loosely typed
languages that enable type coercion.  I'll start with my main three languages - Java, JavaScript,
and Python.  Then I'll run through the remaining ten languages in alphabetical order.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Java">Java</SectionTitle>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=java&page=1">Java</a> has two different categories of types -
primitives and objects.  Primitive types are checked for value equality with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
operator.  Object types are checked for reference equality with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
operator and value equality with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">equals()</code> method found
in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> class.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator tests the values in two variables memory locations
for equality.  Primitive types hold their values directly in their assigned memory space.  Therefore,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> tests for value equality with primitives.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
int five = 5;
int six = 6;
assert five != six;

int fiveAgain = 5;
assert five == fiveAgain;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There is no way to test reference equality with primitives.  Primitives also can't use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
equals()</code> method since they aren't objects and can't have methods.
</p>
<p>
The following code demonstrates how <code className="jarombek-inline-code">String</code> objects are tested for equality.  String literals are unique because
 Java caches them in the same memory location if they have equal values.  As you will soon see, many other
languages use this optimization for strings as well.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
String day = "Saturday the 27th";
String dayAgain = "Saturday the 27th";
String dayAgainAgain = new String("Saturday the 27th");

// This is a unique case.  Java caches string literals (not created with a constructor) so
// that they reference the same underlying object in memory.
assert day == dayAgain;

// When Strings are created with a constructor (like dayAgainAgain), they are not cached and reference
// a new underlying object.
assert day != dayAgainAgain;

// equals() performs value comparison as expected.
assert day.equals(dayAgain);
assert day.equals(dayAgainAgain);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
However, for most objects <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> tests for reference equality and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">equals()</code> tests for value equality.  I created a custom
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Yarn</code> class to demonstrate how object equality works.  For value
equality to work properly, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Yarn</code> overrides the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">equals()</code> method from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
public class Yarn {

  private String fiber;
  private String color;
  private int yards;

  /**
   * Private constructor for a new ball of yarn.  Can only be invoked by the static factory method.

   * @param color The visual color of the yarn.
   * @param yards The length of the yarn in yards.

  private Yarn(String fiber, String color, int yards) {
    this.fiber = fiber;
    this.color = color;
    this.yards = yards;

    return new Yarn(fiber, color, yards);
  }

  /**

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (obj == this)
      return true;
    if (!(obj instanceof Yarn))
      return false;
    var otherYarn = (Yarn) obj;
    return Objects.equals(fiber, otherYarn.fiber)
      && Objects.equals(color, otherYarn.color)

<p>
Variables <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yarn1</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">yarn2</code>
are the only <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Yarn</code> instances that pass reference and value equality tests.
</p>
<p>
While Java is generally a strongly typed language, there are a few occasions where type coercion occurs with
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator.  This is usually due to boxing and un-boxing
primitives along with comparing numeric primitives<sup>2</sup>.  Here are a few examples:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
double two = 2.0;
int twoInt = (int) two;

// This comparison is successful even though two is of type 'double' and twoInt is of type 'int'.
assert two == twoInt;

// This comparison is successful because Integer is coerced (un-boxed) to primitive type int.  new Integer() is now deprecated.
assert 2 == new Integer(2);

Integer twoInteger = 2;
assert twoInt == twoInteger;

// In most cases, comparing two values of different types fails at compile time.
// assert 2 == "2";
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="JavaScript">JavaScript</SectionTitle>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=javascript&page=1">JavaScript</a> has two operators that perform
equality checks - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">===</code>.
When working with primitive types, both operators test value equality.  When working with object types, both
operators test reference equality.
</p>
<p>
There isn't much debate that JavaScript is a loosely typed programming language.  When working with primitives,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> enables implicit type coercion during the comparison.  On the
other hand, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">===</code> prohibits implicit type coercion.  For example,
when comparing a string and a number using <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>, the string is
converted to a numeric type before the comparison occurs.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
assert(2 == "2");
assert("2" == 2);

// This is the same as:
assert(2 === Number("2"));

// If a number is compared to a string using !==, no type coercion occurs.
assert(2 !== "2");
assert("2" !== 2);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Because JavaScript contains a lot of implicit type coercion, many developers argue that you shouldn't use
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> on primitives.  Here are some examples of the confusing
consequences of implicit type coercion:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">

// This first converts 'true' to its number equivalent, which is 1.  Then it converts "0" to a
// number.  Then it compares 1 === 0, which is false.
assert(true != "0");

// This first converts 'false' to its number equivalent, which is 0.  Then it converts "0" to a
// number.  Then it compares 0 === 0, which is true.
assert(false == "0");

// 'true' converts to 1, "1" converts to 1.  The expression 1 === 1 is true.
assert(true == "1");

// 'true' converts to 1, "2" converts to 2.  The expression 1 === 2 is false.
assert(true != "2");

// Since null and undefined are both falsey, comparing them with == returns true.
assert(undefined == null);
assert(null == undefined);

// But with === they return false.
assert(undefined !== null);
assert(null !== undefined);

// However, null and undefined are not equal to any other types, even if their values are falsey
assert(null != "");
assert(null !== "");
assert(null != 0);
assert(null !== 0);
assert(null != false);
assert(null !== false);

// When an object type is compared to a primitive type with ==, the object
// is first coerced into a primitive value.

// An array is a type of object.
assert([10] == 10);
assert([10] == "10");
assert([10] !== "10");

// A function is also a type of object.
assert(() => "hello" == "hello");
assert(() => "100" == "100");
assert(() => "100" == 100);
assert(() => "100" !== 100);

// Objects containing a property with a certain value aren't coerced into that value.
assert({value: 1} != 1);

// However, objects created by passing a primitive value into an object constructor
// are coerced to that value.
assert(new Object(1) == 1);
assert(new Object(1) !== 1);

// You can monkey-patch prototype functions to create strange equality behavior.
const twentyTwo = new Number(22);

assert(23 != 24);
assert(twentyTwo != 23); // 22 != 23 as expected

Number.prototype.valueOf = () => {
  return 23;
};

assert(23 != 24);
assert(twentyTwo == 23); // 22 == 23 unexpectedly due to valueOf() monkey patch.
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When testing object types for equality, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">===</code> operators are much more predictable.  They both test
objects for reference equality.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
assert({} != {});
assert({} !== {});

// Remember that arrays and functions are also objects in JavaScript.
assert([] != []);
assert([] !== []);
assert((() => {}) != (() => {}));
assert((() => {}) !== (() => {}));

const emptyObj1 = {};

// emptyObj2 references the same object in memory as emptyObj1.
const emptyObj2 = emptyObj1;

// emptyObj3 creates a new object with emptyObj1 as its prototype.
const emptyObj3 = Object.create(emptyObj1);

// emptyObj4 uses emptyObj1 as a base object and copies the empty object into the base object.
const emptyObj4 = Object.assign(emptyObj1, {});

assert(emptyObj1 == emptyObj2);
assert(emptyObj1 === emptyObj2);

assert(emptyObj1 != emptyObj3);
assert(emptyObj1 !== emptyObj3);

assert(emptyObj1 == emptyObj4);
assert(emptyObj1 === emptyObj4);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If we want to test objects for value equality, a custom function must be created.  The following function
tests objects for value equality one level deep<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
/**
 * Test for value equality on two objects.  NOTE: nested objects are tested for reference equality.
 * @param a the first object to compare for equality.

const equals = (a, b) => {
  const aProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(a);
  const bProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(b);

  if (aProps.length !== bProps.length) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < aProps.length; i++) {
    const propName = aProps[i];
    if (a[propName] !== b[propName]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};

// Prove that equals() tests for value equality on object properties.
assert(equals({}, {}));
assert(equals({first: 'andy', last: 'jarombek'}, {last: 'jarombek', first: 'andy'}));

// This still won't work for nested objects.
assert(
  !equals(
    {type: 'walk', stats: {minutes: 76, seconds: 40}},
    {type: 'walk', stats: {minutes: 76, seconds: 40}}
  )
);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The following function tests arrays (which are also objects in JavaScript) for value equality<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
/**

<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=bash&page=1">Bash</a> is an outlier in the sense that it's an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-22-2019-bash-scripting#bash-file-basics">untyped language</a>.

Bash provides a couple operators for determining equality of plain text.  All these operators test value
equality.  There is no way that I know of to test reference equality.
</p>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">=</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operators
test for plain text equality.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">-eq</code> operator tests for integer equality.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">

# In Bash everything is plain text except in certain contexts.  Both == and = test for text equality.
# = is defined in the POSIX spec while == is Bash specific.

# [[ conditions ]] has some extended features over [ conditions ], including the use of two
# conditions separated by an && operator.
[[ "${day1}" != "${day2}" && "${day1}" == "${day3}" ]] # true
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="C">C</SectionTitle>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=c&page=1">C</a> has a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
operator for testing type equality.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> can be used to test integer,
floating point, and pointer types for equality.  Integer and floating point equality operations test for
value equality.  Pointer equality operations test for reference equality.  C is strongly typed, so no type
coercion occurs during these equality tests.
</p>
<p>
One of the small differences between the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator in C and
other languages is that in C it returns a number instead of a boolean value.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">1</code> when the two items are equal and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">0</code>
when they aren't.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
int two = 2;
int twoAgain = 2;

int twosAreEqual = two == twoAgain;

assert(two == twoAgain);
assert(twosAreEqual == 1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As I mentioned, comparing two pointers with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator tests
for reference equality.  Similar to other languages, C caches string literals so they point to the same
memory location.  This is proven in the following code:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
char* name = "Andy";
char* nameAgain = "Andy";
char* lastName = "Jarombek";

assert(name == nameAgain);
assert(name != lastName);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Strings in C can be represented as character pointers (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">char*</code>) or character
arrays.  Since character arrays always claim a new slice of memory, reference equality will fail when comparing
them to a character pointer.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C">
char nameArray[] = "Andy";

assert(name != nameArray);
assert(nameAgain != nameArray);
assert(nameArray != lastName);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
C is an imperative programming language and doesn't support classes or objects.  The basic construct it does
support is structs.  Unfortunately the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator doesn't work
with structs.  If you try using it a compile time error will occur.  To test struts for value equality,
each item in the struct must be checked for equality individually.  There is also a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">memcmp()</code>
function available to test structs for value equality, however it isn't always reliable<sup>5,6</sup>.  To test
structs for reference equality, you just need to compare the pointers to the structs.

<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=c#&page=1">C#</a> provides an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
operator, an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Equals()</code> method, and a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
ReferenceEquals()</code> method for testing equality.  When working with primitives, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Equals()</code> test for value equality.  C# is strongly typed so
there is no type coercion when testing for equality.
</p>
<p>
C# is often compared to Java due to similarities in their structure.  However, there are some
differences when it comes to equality.  While Java primitives can't use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
equals()</code> method, C# primitives can.  This is because primitives in C# are aliases for structs.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
int one = 1;
int two = 2;
Assert(one != two);
Assert(!one.Equals(two));
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
When working with custom structs or classes, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Equals()</code> tests for
value equality and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ReferenceEquals()</code> tests for reference equality.
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator is a trickier situation in C#.  Unlike Java, C#
permits operator overloading.  This means a class designer can decide if they want to overload
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> or not.  Depending on this decision, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
may test for value equality or reference equality.
</p>
<p>
For example, the built in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Uri</code> class overloads the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
operator so that it tests for value equality.  I also created a custom <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Yarn</code>
class which doesn't overload <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> so that it maintains reference equality.
The consequences can be seen below:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
Uri jarombekCom = new Uri("https://jarombek.com");
Uri jarombekCom2 = new Uri("https://jarombek.com");

// If this was reference equality, it would return false.
Assert(jarombekCom == jarombekCom2);

Yarn pinkYarn = new Yarn(210, Yarn.YarnWeight.SuperBulky);
Yarn multiColorYarn = new Yarn(70, Yarn.YarnWeight.Bulky);
Yarn anotherPinkYarn = new Yarn(210, Yarn.YarnWeight.SuperBulky);

Assert(pinkYarn.Equals(anotherPinkYarn));
Assert(pinkYarn != anotherPinkYarn); // == still maintains reference equality
Assert(!pinkYarn.Equals(multiColorYarn));
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Luckily you can still use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ReferenceEquals()</code> method in case
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator is overloaded.  If you want to see more examples

<SectionTitle title="Groovy">Groovy</SectionTitle>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=groovy&page=1">Groovy</a> takes Java's type equality system and
makes some major changes to it.  Groovy uses <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> to test for value
equality for all values.  This is different than Java which uses <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
for reference equality with value types.  You can still use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.equals()</code>
in Groovy, however it will provide the same result as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>.  Because
both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.equals()</code>
are used for value equality, Groovy introduced a new method <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object.is()</code>

<p>
Like Java, Groovy is a strongly typed language.  However, there is some type coercion that occurs
when comparing numeric values.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Groovy">
// == coerces different numeric types before comparing

<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=haskell&page=1">Haskell</a> is a functional programming language that
behaves much differently than the other languages I'm looking at today.  It doesn't have reference equality
by default, mostly for performance reasons<sup>7</sup>.  However, you can implement value equality by making
a type an instance of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Eq</code> type class.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Haskell">

-- The type class 'Eq' defines two functions - (==) and (/=).  (/=) has a default definition in the type class, so
-- instances don't need to override it.  Haskell provides a shortcut for making a type an instance of the Eq type class
-- with the 'deriving' keyword.  deriving also works for Ord, Show and Read.
data Yarn = Yarn String String Int
              deriving Eq

-- My custom WrappingPaper type doesn't use the 'deriving Eq' shortcut, instead explicitly making WrappingPaper
-- an instance of Eq.
data WrappingPaper = WrappingPaper String String

instance Eq WrappingPaper where
  WrappingPaper brand1 pattern1 == WrappingPaper brand2 pattern2 = brand1 == brand2 && pattern1 == pattern2
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Once <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Eq</code> is implemented, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code>
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/=</code> operators can be used.  Note that Haskell is strongly typed,

<SectionTitle title="PHP">PHP</SectionTitle>
<p>
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=php&page=1">PHP</a> behaves similarly to JavaScript when it comes
to type equality.  PHP is a loosely typed language that provides two operators for testing equality between
types.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> tests value equality with coercion for primitive types
and tests value equality without coercion for objects.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">===</code> tests
value equality without coercion for primitive types and tests reference equality for objects.  Here are some
examples of primitive type equality checks:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PHP">
assert(2 == '2');
assert("2" == 2);
assert(2 == 2);
assert(true == "1");
assert(false == "0");

// Just like JavaScript, implicit type coercion can cause strange behavior
assert("00" == "0000");
assert(null == array());

// However, you could say it's not "as" loosely typed as JavaScript.  In JavaScript, [10] == 10 returns true.
assert([10] != 10);

// Just like JavaScript, === disallows type coercion.

<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=typescript&page=1">TypeScript</a> takes JavaScripts type equality

making mistakes with type coercion.  You could say that TypeScript is more strongly typed than JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
If you try using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">==</code> operator on two different types, TypeScript
will throw a compile time error:

<code className="jarombek-inline-code">any</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Object</code> types:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">

// Since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, we can trick TypeScript about the compile-time types of

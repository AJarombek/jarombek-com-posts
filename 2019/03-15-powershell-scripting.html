Over the summer I wrote an article about <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-31-2018-batch-scripting">
Batch scripting</a> and just a few weeks ago wrote a follow up on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
feb-22-2019-bash-scripting">Bash scripting</a>.  Today I'm exploring PowerShell scripting on Windows.
I've used PowerShell at work recently for automating the deployment of .NET applications.  The rest of
this article looks at basic features of PowerShell and how it compares to Bash and Batch.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is a PowerShell Script">What is a PowerShell Script?</SectionTitle>
<p>
Powershell is a command line shell and scripting language first released for Windows in 2006<sup>1</sup>.
It was created as a better way to perform command line scripting on Windows.  Before Powershell, Batch
files were used for command line scripting in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">cmd.exe</code> CLI.
While Batch was suitable for basic tasks, the scripting language was rough around the edges and lacked
modern functionality.  PowerShell aimed to improve upon these shortcomings.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="PowerShell File Basics">PowerShell File Basics</SectionTitle>
<p>
PowerShell scripts are files with the <strong>.ps1</strong> extension.  The PowerShell language is
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#dynamic-&-static-typing">
  dynamically typed</a> and contains basic programming constructs familiar to software developers<sup>2</sup>.
Powershell types are objects, and type definitions can be explicitly or implicitly declared on variables<sup>3</sup>.  This
is much different than Bash, which doesn't have types.  In Bash everything is plain text which is
interpreted differently depending on the context.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at a basic example.  PowerShell has very clean syntax for handling script arguments (similar
to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-26-2018-nodejs-command-line">JavaScript command line programs</a>).
In the script parameter definition, I explicitly declare the type of the single parameter as a string.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
# basics.ps1

# Handle script arguments
param (
  [string]$author = "Andrew Jarombek"
)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code declares a single parameter for the <strong>basics.ps1</strong> script.  It creates a new
variable <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$author</code> of type string (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">
[string]</code>).  If no argument is supplied to <strong>basics.ps1</strong>, the default value
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">"Andrew Jarombek"</code> is used.
</p>
<p>
PowerShell scripts are easily invoked in the PowerShell CLI by writing the path of the script followed
by any arguments.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
# No arguments
basics.ps1

# Single argument
basics.ps1 "Andy J"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Variables are written to stdout with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Write-Host</code> command,
which is admittedly a bit more verbose than its <code class="jarombek-inline-code">echo</code> bash
counterpart.  The verbosity of commands is a common PowerShell gripe from developers accustomed to using Bash.  The following command
prints out the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$author</code> parameter.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
Write-Host $author
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Execution Policies">Execution Policies</SectionTitle>
<p>
One complicated aspect of PowerShell is its execution policy.  Execution policies configure requirements
that must be met for a PowerShell script to execute<sup>4</sup>.  By default, the execution policy for
PowerShell on Windows machines is <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Restricted</code>, meaning no scripts
are allowed to execute.  When I first started using PowerShell this was quite confusing since all my scripts
failed before executing.
</p>
<p>
While you can create complex execution policy hierarchies at the process, user, and computer levels
(among others), the most basic way to change the execution policy is with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Set-ExecutionPolicy &lt;policy&gt;</code> command.  For example, the following command changes the
execution policy to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">RemoteSigned</code>, which provides some protection
against running untrustworthy downloaded scripts.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
You can also check the current execution policy with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Get-ExecutionPolicy</code>.
All the different execution policies are explained on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/
powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-6">Microsoft's website</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Working with Objects">Working with Objects</SectionTitle>
<p>
As I previously mentioned, all types in PowerShell are objects.  Because of this, variables have methods
and properties that we can invoke and access.  For example, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">string</code>
type has methods such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Substring()</code> and <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
Replace()</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
[string]$author = "Andrew Jarombek"

# Select just the lastname portion of the author string
$lastname = $author.Substring(7)
Write-Host $lastname

# the -match operator checks if author contains "Jarombek"
$lastname2 = $author -match "Jarombek"
Write-Host $lastname2

# Replace Jarombek with Jarbek
$altauthor = $author.Replace("Jarombek", "Jarbek")
Write-Host $altauthor
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Jarombek
True
Andrew Jarbek
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I also utilized a PowerShell operator <code class="jarombek-inline-code">-match</code> to match a
regular expression to the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">$author</code> string.
</p>
<p>
If you are coming from Batch or Bash, the fact that PowerShell has objects similar to an Object-oriented
programming language is surprising.  PowerShell objects are very helpful in
creating concise scripts and integrate well with IDEs.
</p>
<p>
Because PowerShell has object types, performing arithmetic is simpler than Bash (and much simpler than
Batch).  PowerShell doesn't need an integer context to perform operations like simple addition.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
$age = 23
$ageInTenYears = $age + 10
Write-Host $ageInTenYears
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
33
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">$age</code> is implicitly typed in this example.  It can be explicitly
typed as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">[int]$age = 23</code>.
</p>
<p>
PowerShells object based type system really shines when dealing with more complex types.  For example,
the following script handles the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">DateTime</code> type.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
# Get the current date set on the computer
[DateTime]$CurrentDate = Get-Date -DisplayHint Date

# Demonstrate that there is a lot of functionality availiable on a DateTime object
Write-Host "It is currently Daylight Savings Time: $($CurrentDate.IsDaylightSavingTime())"
Write-Host "Current Month: $($CurrentDate.Month)"
Write-Host "Next Month: $($CurrentDate.AddMonths(1).Month)"

# Prove that $CurrentDate didn't mutate from the previous method invocations
Write-Host $CurrentDate

# Build another DateTime object
[DateTime]$EndOfMonth = (Get-Date -Year 2019 -Month 03 -Day 31)

# Its extremely simple to compare dates
if ($CurrentDate -GT $EndOfMonth) {
  Write-Host "It isn't March Anymore: $CurrentDate"
} else {
  Write-Host "It's still March: $CurrentDate"
}
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
It is currently Daylight Savings Time: True
Current Month: 3
Next Month: 4
3/13/2019 11:21:00 AM
It's still March: 03/13/2019 11:21:00
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code snippet also shows off some modern PowerShell features such as string interpolation.
</p>
<p>
Powershell arrays are also objects that are easy to work with.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
# Basic array syntax @()
[string[]]$names = @("Andy", "Tom", "Joe")

# Arrays are objects with methods and properties
Write-Host $names.GetUpperBound(0)

# Implicitly typed array of towns in Connecticut
$towns = @("Greenwich","Darien","New Canaan","Wilton","Ridgefield")
Write-Host $towns[0]

# Shortened syntax to create an array of a number range
$numberArray = @(0..10)
$subArray = $numberArray[5..9]

# Collect all the towns north of I-95
$northernTownsArray = $towns[2..4]
$northernTownsString = ""

foreach ($element in $northernTownsArray) {
  $northernTownsString += $element + " "
}

Write-Host $northernTownsString

# An alternative way to iterate over an array is to use a pipe and a foreach loop
# Collect all the towns along the coast
$coastalTownsArray = $towns[0..1]
$coastalTownsString = ""

$coastalTownsArray | foreach {
  $coastalTownsString += $_ + " "
}

Write-Host $coastalTownsString

# PowerShell supports multidimensional arrays
$multiDimensional = @(
  @("Andrew", "Jarombek"),
  @("Tom", "Caul"),
  @("Joseph", "Smoth")
)

$tom = $multiDimensional[1][0]
Write-Host $tom
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
2
Greenwich
New Canaan Wilton Ridgefield
Greenwich Darien
Tom
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Writing Functions">Writing Functions</SectionTitle>
<p>
PowerShell has pretty clean syntax for writing functions.  By default variables defined in functions
are scoped locally to the function and don't leak into the global scope.  This is the opposite of Bash
which leaks variables globally by default.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
$age = 23

function Test-Scoping() {
  # $age is scoped locally to the function
  $age = 24
  Write-Host $age
}

Test-Scoping
Write-Host $age
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
24
23
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
To create a global variable from a function, the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">global:</code>
variable prefix is used.  PowerShell also provides a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">script:</code>
variable prefix which persists the variable across function invocations.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
function Test-Scoping-Variables() {
  # By default, variables created in functions are local
  $countLocal = 0

  # By using the $script: prefix, variables are persisted across function calls
  $script:countScript = 0

  # By using the $global: prefix, variables become global
  $global:countGlobal = 0

  Write-Host "Local count: $countLocal, Script count: $script:countScript, Global count: $global:countGlobal"
}

Test-Scoping-Variables
Write-Host "Local count: $countLocal, Script count: $countScript, Global count: $countGlobal"
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Local count: 0, Script count: 0, Global count: 0
Local count: , Script count: 0, Global count: 0
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Function parameters and return values are a bit funky in PowerShell.  Parameters are defined similar
to script parameters with a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">param()</code> block.  Return values
are captured at the end of a function or when a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">return</code> keyword
is encountered.  Therefore a <code class="jarombek-inline-code">return</code> keyword isn't needed for
functions to return a value!  They simply declare a function exit point<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I think the easiest way to demonstrate this behavior is with an example.  The following three functions
multiply a string a number of times and return a new string.  They all behave the same way despite
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">return</code> keyword used differently (or missing entirely) in each.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="PowerShell">
# Output of functions are captured and returned.
# There is a return keyword, but it just specifies an exit point.
function Mult() {
  param([string]$str, [int]$count)
  $str * $count
}

# Therefore, Mult2 is equivalent to Mult...
function Mult2() {
  param([string]$str, [int]$count)
  return $str * $count
}

# ...and Mult3 is equivalent to Mult2 and Mult
function Mult3() {
  param([string]$str, [int]$count)
  $str * $count
  return
}

# The result is the same when invoking the three functions
$meows = Mult -str "meow" -count 3
Write-Host $meows

$meows2 = Mult2 -str "meow" -count 3
Write-Host $meows2

$meows3 = Mult3 -str "meow" -count 3
Write-Host $meows3
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
meowmeowmeow
meowmeowmeow
meowmeowmeow
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Besides for return values, PowerShell functions behave as you likely expect.

One thing that fascinates me is the different design decisions across programming languages.
I really enjoyed comparing the biggest three scripting languages - Bash, PowerShell, and Batch.  I
plan to use all three throughout the rest of my career, and will write more discovery posts about
them as I learn more.  All the code from this article is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/

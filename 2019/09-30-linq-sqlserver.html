My <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-15-2019-linq">previous article</a> explored LINQ,
 a module that brings query syntax to C#.  All the examples in that article queried local data
structures.  While using LINQ on local data is valuable in itself, LINQ can do much more.  LINQ really
shines when used to query remote data sources.  Queries on remote data sources such as relational
databases are known as integrated queries.  In this article, I explore integrated queries with a
SQL Server database.  First I create the SQL Server database instance with Docker and then query
it using LINQ.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="SQL Server with Docker">SQL Server with Docker</SectionTitle>
<p>
SQL Server is a relational database created and maintained by Microsoft.  It's an enterprise centric
database comparable to the Oracle database.  In order to work with integrated queries, I set up a SQL
Server database instance on a Docker container.  This Docker container runs on my local machine and is
 queried from my C# code.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft provides SQL Server Docker container images on their DockerHub repository<sup>1</sup>.
Their <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server</code> image creates an
empty SQL Server database with exposed environment variables that configure passwords, accept license
agreements, and more.
</p>
<p>
While this Docker image provides most of the functionality I need, I also want to pre-populate SQL Server
 with some data.  I found a Microsoft employee's GitHub repository that
 builds a similar Docker image with pre-populated data<sup>2</sup>.  With this repository
and the official SQL Server Docker image as my base, I created the following <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/misc-code-samples/blob/master/C%23/base/linq_basics/database/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Dockerfile">
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest-ubuntu

LABEL maintainer="andrew@jarombek.com" \
      version="0.0.1" \
      description="Dockerfile running SQL Server with pre-populated tables and data"

ENV ACCEPT_EULA Y
ENV SA_PASSWORD LinqDemo1

COPY . /src
WORKDIR /src

EXPOSE 1433
CMD ["bash", "setup-db.sh"]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Since this SQL Server database is only used for demo purposes, I have the database password hard-coded
in the Dockerfile.  Most of the heavy lifting is done in the base <code className="jarombek-inline-code">mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest-ubuntu</code>
image and the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/misc-code-samples/blob/master/C%23/base/linq_basics/
database/setup-db.sh">setup-db.sh</a> Bash script.  The Bash script starts the database and populates it with data.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Turn on monitor mode for job control.
set -m

# Start Microsoft SQL Server and put its task in the background.
/opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr &
jobs

# Wait for the database to start and then populate it with data.
sleep 60s
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P LinqDemo1 -d master -i createDB.sql

# Bring the Microsoft SQL Server task back to the foreground.  This prevents the bash script from exiting,
# killing the Docker container in the process.
fg %1
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The final piece is <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/misc-code-samples/blob/master/C%23/base/linq_basics/
database/createDB.sql">createDB.sql</a> which creates database tables and populates them with data.  For
this demo, I'm using programming language statistics for my data.  There are two tables in the database -
one describing programming languages and another containing the number of lines coded in a language over
the course of a year.  Here is an abbreviated version of the SQL script:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
USE master;

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS LinqDemo;
GO

CREATE DATABASE LinqDemo;
GO

USE LinqDemo;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Language;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS CodeWritten;

CREATE TABLE Language (
  Name VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  ReleaseYear INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE CodeWritten (
  ID INT IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  Language VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL,
  Year INT NOT NULL,
  LinesWritten INT NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT CodeWrittenLanguageFK
    FOREIGN KEY (Language) REFERENCES Language(Name) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO Language (Name, ReleaseYear) VALUES ('Python', 1991);
INSERT INTO Language (Name, ReleaseYear) VALUES ('JavaScript', 1995);
...

INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2014, 0);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2015, 931);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2016, 1122);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2017, 1288);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2018, 1975);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('Python', 2019, 8316);

INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2014, 0);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2015, 0);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2016, 2008);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2017, 6663);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2018, 16414);
INSERT INTO CodeWritten (Language, Year, LinesWritten) VALUES ('JavaScript', 2019, 5617);

...
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The SQL Server Docker image is built and run with the following two commands:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker image build -t misc-code-samples-sqlserver:latest .
docker container run -p 1433:1433 --name misc-code-samples-sqlserver misc-code-samples-sqlserver:latest
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now that the Docker image is up and running, let's explore how to connect LINQ queries to the SQL Server
database instance.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Establishing a Connection Between SQL Server and C#">Establishing a Connection Between SQL Server and C#</SectionTitle>
<p>
To work with SQL Server in C#, we first need to open a connection to the database.  For .NET Core,
the package used to establish this connection is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer</code>.
You can easily install this package with nuget.  The class in this package used to create a database
session and query the tables is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DbContext</code>.  I created a
custom <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageContext</code> class which extends
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">DbContext</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
/// &lt;summary>
/// Class used to connect to SQLServer and allow for queries to be made against the tables.
/// &lt;/summary>
public class LanguageContext : DbContext
{
  public DbSet&lt;Language> LanguageSet { get; set; }
  public DbSet&lt;CodeWritten> CodeWrittenSet { get; set; }

  /// &lt;inheritdoc cref="DbContext.OnConfiguring"/>
  protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
  {
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(
      @"Server=localhost;Database=LinqDemo;User Id=sa;Password=LinqDemo1"
    );
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">OnConfiguring</code> is invoked upon construction of each
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageContext</code> instance.  It establishes a connection
to the database with the supplied connection string.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageContext</code>
also defines two <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DbSet</code> properties which represent tables
in the database.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CodeWritten</code>
are custom model objects containing all the columns and attributes of my tables.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
/// &lt;summary>
/// Model object for the &lt;code>Language&lt;/code> table in SQLServer.
/// &lt;/summary>
[Table("Language")]
public class Language
{
  [Key]
  [Required]
  [Column("Name", TypeName = "VARCHAR(31)")]
  public string Name { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Column("ReleaseYear", TypeName = "INT")]
  public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }

  public List&lt;CodeWritten> CodeWrittenReferences { get; set; }
}

/// &lt;summary>
/// Model object for the &lt;code>CodeWritten&lt;/code> table in SQLServer.
/// &lt;/summary>
[Table("CodeWritten")]
public class CodeWritten
{
  [Key]
  [Required]
  [Column("ID", TypeName = "INT")]
  public int Id { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Column("Year", TypeName = "INT")]
  public int Year { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Column("LinesWritten", TypeName = "INT")]
  public int LinesWritten { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Column("Language", TypeName = "VARCHAR(31)")]
  public string Language { get; set; }

  [ForeignKey("Language")]
  public Language LanguageReference { get; set; }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Model objects are relatively simple, holding the columns in their respective tables.  However, they
also hold their tables relationships such as foreign keys.  This allows for table join operations
to be performed in C#.
</p>
<p>
One potential source of confusion is that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DbSet</code> caches a
tables contents after performing a query.  This means that querying <code className="jarombek-inline-code">DbSet</code> may not reflect changes made to the
database during the lifetime of a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageContext</code> instance.
I won't be inserting, updating, or deleting any data in SQL Server during the following examples, so
we don't need to worry about this scenario.
</p>
<p>
Now that SQL Server and C# are connected, let's perform some integrated queries with LINQ!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="LINQ Integrated Queries">LINQ Integrated Queries</SectionTitle>
<p>
To work with integrated queries, we need an instance of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageContext</code>.
All of the LINQ examples in this article are enclosed in the following <code className="jarombek-inline-code">using</code>
code block<sup>3</sup>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
using (var context = new LanguageContext())
{
  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">using</code> will properly instantiate and tear down the database
context.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LanguageSet</code>
 and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CodeWrittenSet</code> are accessible from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">context</code>.  The following
code confirms that both contain the expected data counts (each language has lines written statistics for six years).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var languages = context.LanguageSet.ToList();
var codeWritten = context.CodeWrittenSet.ToList();

Assert(languages.Count == 18);
Assert(codeWritten.Count == 18 * 6);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Now let's begin using LINQ.  The following queries get the newest and oldest languages in the
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Language</code> table.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

var oldestLanguage = context.LanguageSet.OrderBy(language => language.ReleaseYear).First();
Assert(oldestLanguage.Name == "SQL");

var newestLanguage = context.LanguageSet.OrderByDescending(language => language.ReleaseYear).First();
Assert(newestLanguage.Name == "HCL");
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here are the equivalent SQL queries:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT TOP 1 Name
FROM Language
ORDER BY ReleaseYear;

SELECT TOP 1 Name
FROM Language
ORDER BY ReleaseYear DESC;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These queries are relatively simple and use the same LINQ methods discussed in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/sep-15-2019-linq">previous article</a>.  The next set of queries build on one another, with the
final query performing an inner join.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Query #1
var mostLinesCodedThisYear =
  from written in context.CodeWrittenSet
  where written.Year == 2019
  orderby written.LinesWritten descending
  select written;

var languageCodedMostThisYear = mostLinesCodedThisYear.First();

// Query #2
Assert(languageCodedMostThisYear.Language == "Python");
// Query #3
Assert(languageCodedMostThisYear.LanguageReference.ReleaseYear == 1991);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">

-- Retrieve the code written statistics for this year, ordered by the most coded languages.
SELECT * FROM CodeWritten
WHERE Year = 2019
ORDER BY LinesWritten DESC;

-- The same as the previous query except it only returns the most used language.
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM CodeWritten
WHERE Year = 2019
ORDER BY LinesWritten DESC;

-- Get the release year of the most used language of 2019 by inner joining the CodeWritten and Language tables.
SELECT TOP 1 ReleaseYear FROM CodeWritten
INNER JOIN Language
ON CodeWritten.Language = Language.Name
WHERE Year = 2019
ORDER BY LinesWritten DESC;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These queries demonstrate how our model objects make joining tables easier to do.
</p>
<p>
For certain SQL keywords, LINQ and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">EntityFrameworkCore</code>
package provide functions with equivalent behavior.  For example, using <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Contains()</code>
in a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">where</code> clause is similar to a SQL <code className="jarombek-inline-code">IN</code>
statement and using <code className="jarombek-inline-code">EF.Functions.Like()</code> in a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">where</code>
clause is similar to a SQL <code className="jarombek-inline-code">LIKE</code> statement.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var jLanguages =
  from codeWritten in context.CodeWrittenSet
  where EF.Functions.Like(codeWritten.Language, "J%")
  select codeWritten;

var javaLanguagesArray = new [] {"Java", "JavaScript"};
var javaLanguages =
  from codeWritten in context.CodeWrittenSet
  where javaLanguagesArray.Contains(codeWritten.Language)
  select codeWritten;
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">

-- Get all the code written statistics for languages that start with the letter J.
SELECT * FROM CodeWritten WHERE Language LIKE 'J%';

-- Get the code written statistics for a group of languages.
SELECT * FROM CodeWritten WHERE Language IN ('Java', 'JavaScript');
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
LINQ also has equivalent methods for SQL aggregate functions such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SUM()</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

// Query the code written statistics and group by the language name.  Retrieve the sum of the
// lines of code written for each language.
var languageTotalStats =
  from codeWritten in context.CodeWrittenSet
  orderby codeWritten.Language
  group codeWritten.LinesWritten by codeWritten.Language
  into totals
  select totals.Sum();
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
SELECT SUM(LinesWritten) AS TOTALS
FROM CodeWritten
GROUP BY Language
ORDER BY Language;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you want to work with set operators, LINQ has the tools to do that as well.  It provides a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Concat()</code> method which emulates <code className="jarombek-inline-code">UNION ALL</code>
and a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Union()</code> method which emulates <code className="jarombek-inline-code">UNION</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var oldestLanguages =
  (from language in context.LanguageSet
    orderby language.ReleaseYear
    select language.Name)
  .Take(2);

var newestLanguages =
  (from language in context.LanguageSet
    orderby language.ReleaseYear descending
    select language.Name)
  .Take(2);

// Query #1
var oldAndNew = oldestLanguages.Concat(newestLanguages);

// Query #2
var oldAndNewUnion = oldestLanguages.Union(newestLanguages);
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="SQL">
-- Retrieves the two oldest and two newest languages.
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT TOP 2 Name
  FROM Language
  ORDER BY ReleaseYear
) Oldest
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT TOP 2 Name
  FROM Language
  ORDER BY ReleaseYear DESC
) Newest;

-- Retrieves the two oldest and two newest languages (without duplicates).
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT TOP 2 Name
  FROM Language
  ORDER BY ReleaseYear
) Oldest
UNION
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT TOP 2 Name
  FROM Language
  ORDER BY ReleaseYear DESC
) Newest;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the help of LINQ and the entire C# ecosystem, you can do queries in C# that wouldn't be possible
in SQL alone.  For example, the following code takes two queries and zips their contents together, resulting
in a string.  This string represents a language and the total number of lines written in it.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Query the languages and return just the names in alphabetical order.
var languageNames =
  from language in context.LanguageSet
  orderby language.Name
  select language.Name;

Assert(languageNames.First() == "Bash" && languageNames.Last() == "YAML");

// Query the code written statistics and group by the language name.  Retrieve the sum of the
// lines of code written for each language.
var languageTotalStats =
  from codeWritten in context.CodeWrittenSet
  orderby codeWritten.Language
  group codeWritten.LinesWritten by codeWritten.Language
  into totals
  select totals.Sum();

Assert(languageTotalStats.First() == 3288);

// Zip the two previous queries to associate the language with the total statistics
var languagesZipped = languageNames.ToArray()
  .Zip(languageTotalStats.ToArray(), (name, total) => $"{name} = {total}");

Assert(languagesZipped.First() == "Bash = 3288");
</CodeSnippet>

In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-15-2019-linq">previous article</a> I compared LINQ in C# 
to PL/SQL in the Oracle database.  I believe this article enforces that claim and proves that incorporating 
query syntax into an imperative language is extremely expressive and powerful.  While there are some 
differences between the LINQ queries and their SQL equivalents, learning LINQ is very easy for someone 
who already knows SQL.  While I don't currently use C# for any of my personal projects, if I ever do I 
will take full advantage of LINQ and the power it gives developers.  You can check out the full code 
for this article on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/misc-code-samples/tree/master/C%23/base/linq_basics">GitHub</a>.

During free time at work, I've been reading a book called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920083634.do">
C# 7.0 In a Nutshell</a>.  When I get home, I write <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=c#&page=1">C#</a>
 <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/misc-code-samples/tree/master/C%23/base">programs</a> based on
what I learned.  One of the really interesting topics I read about was LINQ (Language Integrated Query),
which is the integration of query functions and keywords in the C# language<sup>1</sup>.  LINQ can be used
to query remote data sources such as an RDBMS or local data structures.
</p>
<p>
LINQ reminds me of writing PL/SQL, which is a procedural language provided for the Oracle database.
PL/SQL is a superset of SQL, allowing for looping, variable declarations, conditional logic, error
handling, and more.  The best feature of PL/SQL is the integration of SQL queries directly into an
imperative programming language.  Unfortunately, PL/SQL is strictly tied to the Oracle database and
 has clunky syntax in my opinion.  LINQ on the other hand can be used with multiple different databases
along with local data structures.  Also, in my opinion, C# has much nicer syntax.
</p>
<p>
I'll save my exploration of integrating LINQ with a remote database for a future article.  Today,
I'm focusing on LINQ basics with local data structures.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Introduction to LINQ">Introduction to LINQ</SectionTitle>
<p>
LINQ is found in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">System.Linq</code> namespace in C#.  LINQ
 queries consume an input sequence and produce an output sequence.  They provide the ability to query
 enumerable data in local data structures or remote data sources.  For example, LINQ is available for
a locally defined dictionary.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
Dictionary&lt;string, int> deerSpottedToday = new Dictionary&lt;string, int>
{
  {"Mianus River Park", 2},
  {"Cognewaugh Road", 1}
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This dictionary represents the number of deer I saw walking and driving.  There are two approaches
for using LINQ with this dictionary.  The first approach is called fluent syntax, which utilizes chainable
static extension methods defined on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">IEnumerable</code>
interface<sup>2</sup>.  An extension method is a method added to an existing type without modifying
the type definition.  The second approach is called query syntax, which uses native keywords to build queries.
</p>
<p>
Below is a filtering query performed on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">deerSpottedToday</code>
dictionary.  It uses fluent syntax and the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Where()</code> extension method.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, int>> multipleDeer = Enumerable.Where(
  deerSpottedToday,
  spot => spot.Value > 1
);

Assert(multipleDeer.Count() == 1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Where()</code> accepts a delegate (lambda function) as an argument.
It checks each element in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">deerSpottedToday</code> to see if they
match the delegate predicate.  Only <code className="jarombek-inline-code">"Mianus River Park"</code>
matches the predicate because it's the only dictionary element with a value greater than 1.
</p>
<p>
In this code sample, I called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Where()</code> directly on the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Enumerable</code> class.  However, it's also invokable directly
on the dictionary instance.  This is because <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Dictionary</code>
implements <code className="jarombek-inline-code">IEnumerable</code>.  The code above can be shortened
to use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">IEnumerable</code> extension method.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var multipleDeer = deerSpottedToday.Where(spot => spot.Value > 1);
Assert(multipleDeer.Count() == 1);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Query syntax uses C# keywords instead of method calls.  This is my favorite aspect of LINQ.  Rewriting
the fluent syntax method chain in query syntax results in the following statement:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var multipleDeer =
  from spottedDeer in deerSpottedToday
  where spottedDeer.Value > 1
  select spottedDeer;

Assert(multipleDeer.Count() == 2);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Query syntax is more reminiscent of SQL, although LINQ and SQL have some major differences (as I'll
explore in my next article).  Let's quickly run through the different pieces of this query.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">from {x} in {y}</code> defines the input sequence for the query
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">y</code>) and loops through its contents, which are assigned
to a variable (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">x</code>). <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
where {condition}</code> defines a filter for the data, in my case a dictionary item must have a value greater
than 1.  Finally, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">select {z}</code> defines which items
 (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">z</code>) to will be present in the output sequence of the query.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at some other operators offered by LINQ.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">orderby</code>
provides the ability to sort the output sequence of the query before returning it.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

double[] walksPastWeek = { 3.5, 2.48, 3.6, 3.98, 3.59, 1.74, 1.54 };

// Linq query with additional OrderBy() and Select() query operator methods.
// Select() is basically a map() function.
var greaterThanTwoMiles = walksPastWeek.Where(miles => miles > 2)
  .OrderBy(miles => miles)
  .Select(miles => Math.Round(miles));

Assert(greaterThanTwoMiles.Count() == 5);
Assert(greaterThanTwoMiles.First() == 2);

// The fluent syntax query above can be rewritten in query syntax:
var greaterThanTwoMilesAgain =
  from distance in walksPastWeek
  where distance > 2
  orderby distance
  select Math.Round(distance);

Assert(greaterThanTwoMilesAgain.Count() == 5);
Assert(greaterThanTwoMilesAgain.First() == 2);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">orderby {x} descending</code> is used to sort in reverse order.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

var greaterThanTwoMilesDesc = greaterThanTwoMiles.OrderByDescending(miles => miles);

Assert(greaterThanTwoMilesDesc.First() == 4);

var greaterThanTwoMilesDescAgain =
  from miles in greaterThanTwoMiles
  orderby miles descending
  select miles;

Assert(greaterThanTwoMilesDescAgain.First() == 4);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One interesting aspect of LINQ queries is that they don't produce output sequences when defined.
They exhibit deferred execution<sup>3</sup>.  Deferred execution results in some interesting behavior.
</p>
<p>
Deferred execution is proven by altering the input sequence after the LINQ query is declared.  In
the following example, the result of the query changes when the input sequence is altered.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
var deerSpottedThisWeek = deerSpottedToday;

var deerQuery =
  from deerSpotted in deerSpottedThisWeek
  where deerSpotted.Value > 1
  select deerSpotted;

// Right now, there is only one location where more than one deer was spotted.
Assert(deerQuery.Count() == 1);

// I saw another deer on Cognewaugh Road today.
deerSpottedThisWeek["Cognewaugh Road"] = 2;

// Due to deferred execution, now there are two locations where more than one deer was spotted.
Assert(deerQuery.Count() == 2);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Deferred execution makes LINQ queries reusable for a mutating data structure.  Deferred execution also
allows LINQ queries to contain local variables that can change between executions.  For example, the
following query has a configurable <code className="jarombek-inline-code">where</code> clause.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

// If the values of lexical scope variables referenced in a query change before execution,
// the query will honor that change.
int numOfDeer = 2;
var sameDeerQuery =
  from deerSpotting in deerSpottedThisWeek
  where deerSpotting.Value >= numOfDeer
  select deerSpotting;

// When numOfDeer is 2, there are two locations that match the query.
Assert(sameDeerQuery.Count() == 2);

numOfDeer = 3;

// When numOfDeer is 3, there are no locations that match the query.
Assert(sameDeerQuery.Count() == 0);
</CodeSnippet>

This article introduced LINQ, a framework that integrates queries into C#.  I decided to write about
LINQ because it's a feature I believe more programming languages should consider adopting.  So much code
is based around filtering, mapping, and reducing data.  The more options developers have to accomplish
these task the better.  Check out my next LINQ article where I discuss integrated queries with LINQ
and SQL Server.

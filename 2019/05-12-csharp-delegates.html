C# has an object called a delegate which is similar to lambda functions and functional interfaces in
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=java&page=1">Java</a>.  A delegate object has a single role -
calling a method.  This article explores delegates and compares them to similar language constructs in
C# and Java.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Delegate Basics">Delegate Basics</SectionTitle>
<p>
A delegate type defines the return type and parameters required for a function to be one of its
instances<sup>1</sup>.  For example, the following <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Combiner</code>
delegate must take in two integer arguments and return a single integer.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
delegate int Combiner(int x, int y);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The following two functions are compatible with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Combiner</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
static int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
static int Subtract(int x, int y) => x - y;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Combiner</code> delegate and these basic functions, I
created a basic gambling simulator.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Gamble</code> method
internally assigns the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Add</code> or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Subtract</code> functions to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Combiner</code> delegate type.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
/// &lt;summary>
/// Method which uses the Combiner delegate internally.  Dynamically picks between the Add and Subtract methods
/// at runtime, depending on a random number value.  This method simulates gambling money.
/// &lt;/summary>
/// &lt;param name="balance">Your total account balance.&lt;/param>
/// &lt;param name="risking">The amount of money from your balance you are gambling.&lt;/param>
/// &lt;returns>Your new account balance.  Will either increase or decrease by the amount you gamble.&lt;/returns>
static int Gamble(int balance, int risking)
{
  Random random = new Random();
  int randomNumber = random.Next(0, 10);

  Combiner combiner = (randomNumber >= 5) ? (Combiner) Add : Subtract;

  return combiner(balance, risking);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  /* Testing Program.cs */

  int newBalance = Gamble(1000, 100);

  // Gambling 100 dollars either increases or decreases your balance by 100 dollars
  Assert(newBalance == 1100 || newBalance == 900);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Delegates in C# and lambda functions in Java really shine when used with higher order functions.
For example, the following code passes a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Transformer</code> delegate
as an argument to a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Map</code> function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
delegate int Transformer(int x);

/// &lt;summary>
/// Performs a transformation on every element of the list.  Keeps the original list in-tact, returns a new
/// list instance.
/// &lt;/summary>
static List&lt;int> Map(List&lt;int> list, Transformer transformer) => list.ConvertAll(x => transformer(x));

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  // Create a function to assign to a delegate and a list of integers
  int Doubler(int x) => x * 2;
  var list = new List&lt;int> {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 31};

  // Call the delegate function on every list item
  var newList = Map(list, Doubler);

  // Prove that the new list is mapped to new values
  Assert(newList[0].Equals(10));
  Assert(newList[5].Equals(62));

  // Prove that the original list wasn't mutated
  Assert(list[0].Equals(5));
  Assert(list[5].Equals(31));
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
So far, nothing I've shown you about delegates differentiates them from Java lambda functions and
functional interfaces.  Both delegates and functional interfaces know how to call a function
with a certain return value and parameter types.  For example, the following Java code maps values
in a list with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Transformer</code> functional interface just
like the last example.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Transformer {
  Integer transform(Integer x);
}

public class Delegates {

  private static List&lt;Integer> map(List&lt;Integer> list, Transformer transformer) {
    List&lt;Integer> newList = new ArrayList<>(list);
    newList.replaceAll(transformer::transform);
    return newList;
  }

  public static void main(String ...args) {
    Transformer transformer = x -> x * 2;
    var list = List.of(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 31);

    var newList = map(list, transformer);

    assert newList.get(0) == 10;
    assert newList.get(5) == 62;

    assert list.get(0) == 5;
    assert list.get(5) == 31;
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If you weren't already aware, functional interfaces in Java are just interfaces with a single method.
Java functional interfaces expose what the C# delegate pattern truly is - an interface that knows how
to call a method.  Delegates are a shortened syntax for a single method interface.  You can easily write
an interface in C# to perform the same logic as a delegate<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Wellâ€¦ for the most part.  The similarities between delegates, functional interfaces, and interfaces
breaks down in regards to multicasting.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Multicasting with Delegates">Multicasting with Delegates</SectionTitle>
<p>
Multicasting is one of the most interesting aspects of Delegates in C#.  Multicasting is a form of
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-6-2018-haskell-pt3">function composition</a> where the delegate
invokes multiple functions.  Think of multicasting as a way of combining
delegate instances together.  This pattern makes more sense with an example.
</p>
<p>
The following code defines a delegate type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TransformerRef</code> and
two functions named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Increment</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Triple</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
/// &lt;summary>
/// Same as the &lt;code>Transformer&lt;/code> delegate except it uses ref returns and ref parameters.
/// &lt;/summary>
delegate ref int TransformerRef(ref int x);

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  // Create a function that increments an integer, using a single memory location
  ref int Increment(ref int x)
  {
    x++;
    return ref x;
  }

  // Create another function that triples an integer, using a single memory location
  ref int Triple(ref int x)
  {
    x *= 3;
    return ref x;
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These functions use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ref</code> return types and arguments so that
the integer value is modified in place (at a single location in memory) instead of creating a new
integer.  Both can be made instances of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TransformerRef</code>
  delegate type.
</p>
<p>
Now let's make a delegate instance with multicasting.  The following delegate instance combines
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Increment</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Triple</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Create a delegate with two methods.  Increment is called first, Triple is called second
TransformerRef transformer = Increment;
transformer += Triple;

// Prove that integers are transformed in place
var i = 5;
transformer(ref i);

Assert(i == 18);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The above code proved that the value <strong>5</strong> is first increment and then tripled.
</p>
<p>
Delegate instances with multicasting are easily modified after creation.  Let's say I
want the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">transformer</code> delegate instance to only triple the
value.  To do this, I simply remove the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Increment</code> function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Remove the increment function from the delegate
transformer -= Increment;

// Prove that the only transformation executed is Triple.
var j = 10;
transformer(ref j);

Assert(j == 30);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Multicasting is a very powerful aspect of delegates in C#.  It helps separate them from patterns
found in comparable languages like Java.

<p>
Similar to how the Java standard library exposes multiple functional interfaces for use, C# provides
delegate types in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">System</code> namespace.  These types can
often be used instead of a custom type.  I recreated the commonly used <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Filter</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Reduce</code> functions for the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">List</code> type using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
System.Func</code> delegate type.  That code is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2019/05-May/05-12-csharp-delegates/csharp/Util.cs">GitHub</a>.

<SectionTitle title="Similar C# Patterns">Similar C# Patterns</SectionTitle>
<p>
One confusing thing about the C# language is the two arrow functions at a developers disposal.
Without background knowledge, it's hard to decide which pattern to use in which context, and at worst
it feels like feature bloat. Along with delegates, C# also offers lambda functions and local methods.
It's important to understand the differences between these three options.
</p>
<p>
As we've discussed, a delegate knows how to call one or many method(s).  It doesn't matter if this
method is a standard function, lambda function, or local method.  They all work with delegates!
</p>
<p>
A lambda function is a nameless function that uses the fat arrow syntax <code className="jarombek-inline-code">args => result</code>.
It can take the place of a standard function in a delegate instance.  One of the limitations of
lambda functions is that they must be assigned to a delegate type<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
With C# 7.0 (released in 2017), local methods were added.  Local methods are only visible in their
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-9-2017-js-closure-modules">lexical scope</a>.  Unlike lambda
functions, local methods don't need to be assigned to a delegate type.  This gives them greater
flexibility.  Otherwise, they use the same fat arrow syntax as lambda functions.
</p>
<p>
In many cases local methods are the easiest approach since you don't have to define a delegate
type.  However, in some cases delegate types are needed.  For example, only lambda functions can
be passed as arguments to other functions.
</p>

Delegates are a very interesting design pattern in C#.  I think they're an elegant simplification
for the single method interface pattern.  I look forward to learning more about C# in the coming
months.  All the code from this article is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/

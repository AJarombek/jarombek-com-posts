While reading a book on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=c#&page=1">C#</a>, I came across a
section about garbage collection.  I always knew that programming languages such as Java performed garbage
 collection, but I never researched how garbage collectors (GCs) worked.  The book mentioned that
C# uses a tracing GC with generations and marking.  These were foreign concepts to me, so I decided
to conduct additional research on the topic.  This article gives a high-level overview of garbage
collectors and the APIs available to interact with them in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=java&page=1">Java</a>
and C#.

<Definition word="Garbage Collector">
<p>
A Garbage Collector (GC) is a task that deletes occupied memory allocated by a program<sup>1</sup>.  GCs
look for memory that is no longer referenced anywhere in the program.  When found, data occupying this
memory space is deleted and the region is reclaimed for future use.
</p>
<p>
Since GCs are run implicitly as a program executes, garbage collection is a form of automatic memory
management.  The opposite of automatic memory management is manual memory management, where memory is
allocated and deallocated by the programmer.  Many modern programming languages use garbage collection,
including Java, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=python&page=1">Python</a>, and C#.  Some older
 programming languages use manual memory management instead, with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=c&page=1">C</a> as a notable example.
</p>

<p>
While GCs are commonly associated with object oriented programming languages, the first GC appeared
in Lisp, a functional programming language.  Other functional programming languages such as
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=haskell&page=1">Haskell</a> utilize garbage collection.
</p>
<p>
There are two main approaches for garbage collection - reference counting and tracing.

<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Reference Counting
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Reference counting in the context of garbage collection is when each object or data maintains a counter.
This counter represents the number of other objects or pieces of data that maintain a reference to it.
For example, for objects <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
B</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> if object <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
B</code> contains a reference to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> and object
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> contains a reference to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
A</code>, the reference count of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> is two.
</p>
<p>
When a GC uses reference counting, it removes objects that have a reference count of zero<sup>2</sup>.
Since these objects are no longer accessible anywhere in the code, they are safely deleted.  In
practice, reference counting has a number of drawbacks which make it a naive approach to garbage
collection<sup>3</sup>.  There is a significant speed and memory overhead to maintaining a reference
counter for each object on the heap.  Also, reference counters run into issues when dealing with cycles.
If an object exists that references itself, it will never be deleted by the garbage collector.  Because
of these shortcomings, tracing is usually used in modern GCs.
</p>

<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Tracing
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
When a GC uses tracing, it defines root objects or data and checks their reference chains.  If an
object is referrable directly or indirectly from a root object, the GC keeps it alive<sup>4</sup>.  If
an object doesn't appear anywhere on the reference chain, it is deleted.  This process is referred to
as 'tracing the reference chain<sup>5</sup>.'
</p>
<p>
For example, for objects <code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
B</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code> if root object
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">A</code> contains a reference to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
B</code> and object <code className="jarombek-inline-code">B</code> contains a reference to
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">C</code>, then the reference chain is traced as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">A -> B -> C</code>.  In this scenario, all three objects are kept
alive.  Languages such as C# and Java use tracing garbage collectors.

<SectionTitle title="Garbage Collection Steps">Garbage Collection Steps</SectionTitle>
<p>
Both Java and C# utilize mark and compact garbage collectors<sup>6,7</sup>.  Marking is when each object
or piece of data that will be removed by the GC is marked for deletion.  This occurs right before the
GC deletes objects.  Compacting occurs after objects marked for deletion are removed from memory.
Compacting moves all remaining objects to the first open memory addresses reserved for objects (the heap).  This
helps prevent memory fragmentation, which is when small pockets of unused memory exist in-between used
memory segments.  This memory often goes to waste if newly created objects can't fit in the space.
</p>
<p>
The GCs used by Java and C# are also generational.  Generational garbage collectors stem from the observation
that most objects are either short lived or persistently maintained<sup>8</sup>.  Implementations of
generational garbage collection vary, however the basic concepts are constant.  Newer objects are members
of newer generations, while older objects are members of older generations.  Newer generations are marked
and compacted on every garbage collection run, while older generations are only marked and compacted
 occasionally.  This is an optimization technique, since garbage collection algorithms have a time and
space complexity that is detrimental towards application performance.  This is especially true for garbage
collection cycles that are "Stop the World" events, where the normal program execution is halted to
run the garbage collector<sup>9</sup>.  Some GCs also have special generations or memory space for large
objects which are expensive to garbage collect<sup>10</sup>.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, when a garbage collection cycle begins the GC marks objects for deletion using reference
counting or tracing.  Marking occurs for newer generations on every garbage collection cycle and for
older generations on a less regular basis.  After marking is completed, the marked objects are deleted
from memory.  Finally, the memory allocated for objects (the heap) is compressed.

<SectionTitle title="Garbage Collection APIs">Garbage Collection APIs</SectionTitle>
<p>
Programming languages often provide APIs to configure and interact with the garbage collector.  These can
be either CLI arguments or modules developers can import into their code.  Java provides multiple CLI
options for configuring the GC, including which garbage collection approach to use<sup>11</sup>.  For
example, developers can choose between the older CMS garbage collector and newer <a href="https://www.oracle.com/
technetwork/tutorials/tutorials-1876574.html">G1 GC</a>.
</p>
<p>
From an API perspective, Java only exposes a single method that ties into the garbage collector.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Java">
System.gc();
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">gc()</code> sends a recommendation to the JVM to run a garbage
collection cycle<sup>12</sup>.  It's important to note that this is just a recommendation, there is a
chance that the GC will not run after invoking <code className="jarombek-inline-code">gc()</code>.
</p>
<p>
C# exposes a much more robust API for the garbage collector.  Some of the available methods and properties
are shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// The C# garbage collector has three heap divisions - gen0, gen1, and gen2.  Newly allocated objects are
// in gen0.  Objects which survived a single garbage collection are in gen1.  All other objects are in gen2.
Assert(GC.MaxGeneration == 2);

// You can force the CLR to run a garbage collection cycle by calling Collect().
GC.Collect();

// You can specify which generation is collected by passing an argument to Collect().
GC.Collect(0);
GC.Collect(1);
GC.Collect(2);

// Finalizers delay garbage collection of objects.  You can force these objects to be collected by calling
// Collect() after WaitForPendingFinalizers().
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.Collect();

// GC uses a separate heap for large objects.  The large heap's memory isn't compacted on
// garbage collection by default ...
Assert(GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode == GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.Default);

// However it can be enabled.  NOTE:  Moving large objects in memory is a slow operation.
GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode = GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce;

// For diagnosis purposes, we can check how much memory is used by the C# process
Console.WriteLine(GC.GetTotalMemory(true));
</CodeSnippet>

This article only scratches the surface of garbage collectors and the APIs they expose in programming
languages.  I now understand a bit more about what happens when garbage collection cycles occur in my programs.
I'm excited to continue learning more and maybe one day implement a garbage collector of my own!

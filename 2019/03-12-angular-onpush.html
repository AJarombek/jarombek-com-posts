In other articles the past couple months I’ve explored lifecyles in <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/jan-18-2019-react-lifecycles">React</a> and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
nov-24-2018-angular-lifecycles">Angular</a>.  Certain lifecycles in React and Angular are triggered
by their respective change detection mechanisms.  In React the change detection mechanism is triggered
whenever a components state changes or the properties passed from a parent component change.  In Angular
the change detection mechanism is triggered whenever a DOM event occurs or values used in the component
template are mutated (along with async code returning, timeouts completing, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Angular also allows us to change the change detection strategy on a per-component basis.  This post
explores the two change detection strategies - <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="How Default change detection works">How <code class="jarombek-header-code">Default</code> Change Detection Works</SectionTitle>
<p>
By default, Angular uses the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default</code>
change detection strategy.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> tracks alterations with
Angular’s two-way data binding system.  One thing this strategy checks for is changes to variables in
the component templates<sup>1</sup>.  Variable alterations include both value and reference changes.
</p>
<p>
Another thing <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> checks for is DOM events.  At a low
level Angular monkey patches functions in the DOM API such as <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
addEventListener()</code><sup>2</sup>.  This allows Angular to perform its own logic whenever the DOM
is altered or interacted with.
</p>
<Definition word="Monkey Patch">
Alterations to a function or other component of a program at runtime.  The patch is only visible to
the current programs execution context.  Monkey patching occurs in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
sep-14-2018-groovy-dynamic">dynamic programming languages</a>.
</Definition>
<p>
A few other things <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> change detection checks for includes
asynchronous callbacks and timeout completions<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Hoe OnPush change detection works">How <code class="jarombek-header-code">OnPush</code> Change Detection Works</SectionTitle>
<p>
  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</code> change detection is used as an
  optimization technique.  When it comes to DOM events <code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> works
  similarly to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code>.  The DOM API is monkey patched and change
  detection runs when a DOM event occurs.
</p>
<p>
Differences arise when handling alterations to variables in component templates.  By using <code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code>,
we tell Angular that the component uses immutable objects in its template<sup>4</sup>.
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> will only trigger change detection when a variable
reference changes.  Change detection will <strong>not</strong> trigger when a template variable is mutated.
</p>

<p>
To help visualize the differences between <code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> and
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> I created an Angular application with two nearly
identical components.  One uses <code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> and the other uses
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">Default</code> change detection.  I log every time a change detection
cycle occurs to make things more clear.

<p>
The major takeaway from this project is that <code class="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> results
in much fewer change detection cycles.  However, be careful and make sure all objects are immutable.
If variables mutate, unexpected UI changes (or lack thereof) are likely to occur.

I find it very interesting how Angular handles its change detection mechanism.  I look forward to learning
more about the topic in the future.  You can check out the code for my change detection project on

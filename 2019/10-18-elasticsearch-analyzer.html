One of the biggest strengths of <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-15-2019-elasticsearch#elasticsearch">
Elasticsearch</a> is text searching.  Elasticsearch holds strings for text searching in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> data types.  A document can contain one or more fields
of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code>.
</p>
<p>
When strings are placed into a field of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> they are
processed by an analyzer.  Elasticsearch analyzers can be viewed as a pipeline that takes text as an input,
breaks it into terms, and returns the terms as output<sup>1</sup>.  These terms are placed in an inverted
index which makes an index searchable.
</p>
<Definition word="Inverted Index">
<p>
An inverted index is a data structure commonly used to perform quick text searching.  Each
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> field in Elasticsearch has a corresponding inverted
index<sup>2</sup>.  The purpose of an inverted index is to map terms to the documents they appear in<sup>3</sup>.
Terms are created from text with the help of an analyzer.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's take a field in a document with an ID of 1.  If the field contains the text "Hello World"
and an analyzer creates a term for each word, the corresponding inverted index would contain two terms - "Hello"
and "World".  Both these terms would be mapped to ID #1.
</p>
<p>
When fields are queried in a text search, document matches are determined by the terms in the inverted
index.  For example, if the text search is "Hello", the document with ID #1 will be returned.  Importantly,
text search matches aren't determined by the contents of a documents JSON, only by the terms in the inverted index.
</p>
</Definition>
<p>
Analyzers are critical in determining whether a text search returns a document.  The remainder
of this article explores the components of analyzers and the impact they have on the inverted index.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Components of Analyzers">Components of Analyzers</SectionTitle>
<p>
Each field of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> is processed by an analyzer.  There are
three main components of analyzers - character filters, tokenizers, and token filters.
</p>
<ComparisonTable title="Elasticsearch Constructs">
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Character Filter
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The first component of an analyzer is the character filter.  Character filters operate on text passed
into the analyzer.  Analyzers have zero or more character filters.  The purpose of a character filter
 is to transform text<sup>4</sup>.  This transformed text is passed along to the next analyzer component,
the tokenizer.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Tokenizer
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The second component of an analyzer is the tokenizer.  Tokenizers take the input text of the analyzer (or
the transformed text from character filters) and creates tokens<sup>5</sup>.  Each analyzer must have a
single tokenizer.  Tokens created by the tokenizer are either returned from the analyzer or passed onto the
token filter(s).
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Token Filter
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
The third and final component of an analyzer is the token filter.  Token filters add, delete, or modify the
tokens created by the tokenizer<sup>6</sup>.  Analyzers have zero or more token filters.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
</ComparisonTable>
<p>
When an analyzer executes, it sequentially runs the character filter(s), tokenizer, and token filter(s) in
order, respectively.  Elasticsearch has many built-in character filters, tokenizers, and token filters for
use.  Elasticsearch also allows developers to create their own components.  With the help of built-in and
custom components, analyzers can be configured to suit most needs.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to spend time customizing an analyzer, Elasticsearch provides multiple built-in analyzers
that work for most requirements.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Working with Analyzers">Working with Analyzers</SectionTitle>
<p>
Elasticsearch exposes the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/_analyze</code> endpoint to work directly
with an analyzer.  This is great for testing the behavior of analyzers and exploring how they tokenize
text.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/_analyze</code> can be called on an individual index or
the entire Elasticsearch cluster.
</p>
<p>
The most basic usage of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/_analyze</code> is to run an analyzer on
a string of text.  The following API call executes the build-it <code className="jarombek-inline-code">standard</code>
analyzer on the text <strong>Hello my name is Andy.</strong>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/_analyze?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "analyzer": "standard",
  "text": "Hello my name is Andy."
}'
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
{ "tokens": ["hello", "my", "name", "is", "andy"] }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I abbreviated the API response to include only the resulting tokens.  This same API call can be executed in
the Kibana UI:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/10-18-19-kibana-analyzer.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The standard analyzer consists of zero character filters, the standard tokenizer, and a lowercase token
filter<sup>7</sup>.  The standard tokenizer removes punctuation and places each word in a separate
token<sup>8</sup>.  After the standard tokenizer runs, the tokens are in the following form:
</p>
<CodeSnippet>
{ "tokens": ["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Andy"] }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the tokens above are different than the end result of the standard analyzer (the uppercase
characters still exist).  This is where the standard analyzer's token filter comes into play.  As its name
suggests, the lowercase token filter modifies tokens by converting uppercase characters to lowercase.
After the lowercase token filter runs, the tokens become <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
["hello", "my", "name", "is", "andy"]</code>.
</p>
<p>
The standard analyzer is one of many built-in analyzers.  Another example of a built-in analyzer is the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">whitespace</code> analyzer.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/_analyze?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "analyzer": "whitespace",
  "text": "Hello my name is Andy."
}'
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
{ "tokens": ["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Andy."] }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/_analyze</code> endpoint also accepts character filters,
token filters, and a tokenizer as input.  The following example uses the standard tokenizer and a character
filter that strips HTML tags from text.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/_analyze?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "tokenizer": "standard",
  "char_filter": ["html_strip"],
  "text": "&lt;h1>Title&lt;/h1>"
}'
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
{ "tokens": ["Title"] }
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Indexes with Custom Analyzers">Indexes with Custom Analyzers</SectionTitle>
<p>
All the examples so far called the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">/_analyze</code> endpoint on
the entire cluster.  While this is beneficial for testing, its less useful in practice.  Custom analysers
become especially advantageous once we start attaching them to indexes and fields on types within an index.
</p>
<p>
Custom analyzers can be defined within the JSON configuration object of an index.  The following custom
analyzer consists of the whitespace tokenizer and a custom <code className="jarombek-inline-code">emoji_filter</code>
character filter.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 5,
      "number_of_replicas": 2
    },
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "emoji_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "whitespace",
          "char_filter": [
            "emoji_filter"
          ]
        }
      },
      "char_filter": {
        "emoji_filter": {
          "type": "mapping",
          "mappings": [
            "🙂 => :)",
            "🙁 => :(",
            "😀 => :D"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If this JSON configuration is saved in <strong>index.json</strong>, the following API call creates the
  index and names it <code className="jarombek-inline-code">test</code>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPUT ${ES_ENDPOINT}/test -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @data/test/index.json
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The whitespace tokenizer creates a new token each time it encounters whitespace.  The custom emoji character
filter turns unicode emojis to ascii compliant emoticons.  The following API call demonstrates how to
use the custom analyzer.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/test/_analyze -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "analyzer": "emoji_analyzer",
  "text": "😀"
}'
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
{ "tokens": [":D"] }
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Here are three more examples of custom analyzers:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 5,
      "number_of_replicas": 2

      "analyzer": {
        "email_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "email"
        },
        "short_words_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "short_words"
        },
        "long_words_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": ["english_stop"]
        }
      },
      "filter": {
        "english_stop": {
          "type": "stop",
          "stopwords": "_english_"
        }
      },

          "group": 1
        },
        "short_words": {
          "type": "classic",
          "max_token_length": 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">

And here are the responses from the API calls:

</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Fields with Custom Analyzers">Fields with Custom Analyzers</SectionTitle>
<p>
It's time to demonstrate how analyzers work end-to-end.  Analyzers are executed on two occasions - when
a document is created with a field of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> and when
a text field is queried.
</p>
<p>
Before creating a document, an index is needed with a custom analyzer and a type mapping.  Notice that the type mapping contains
a single field of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">text</code> called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code>.
This field has two additional properties - <code className="jarombek-inline-code">analyzer</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">search_analyzer</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">

</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">analyzer</code> declares the analyzer used when documents are indexed.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">search_analyzer</code> declares the analyzer used when text searches
 execute.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> field uses a custom analyzer with a n-gram
tokenizer when indexed and the standard analyzer when queried.  The n-gram tokenizer creates tokens of
length four through ten.
</p>
<p>
With the index definition created, it's time to populate it with some documents:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/tech/_doc/1 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"name": "Elasticsearch"}'
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/tech/_doc/2 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"name": "Logstash"}'
curl -XPOST ${ES_ENDPOINT}/tech/_doc/3 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"name": "Kibana"}'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If we could view the inverted index for the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> field, it
would look something like this<sup>8,9</sup>:
</p>
<span className="code-span">
| Term       | Appearances (Document, Frequency) |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Elas       | (1,1)                             |

|------------|-----------------------------------|
</span>
<p>
Viewing the inverted index is helpful since we can see the result of the n-gram tokenizer.  Since the
standard analyzer is used on the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> field at query time,
the following query returns the first document.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
curl ${ES_ENDPOINT}/tech/_doc/_search?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "stic"
    }
  }
}'
</CodeSnippet>
<p>This query would not have returned the first document if the entire <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>
string was stored in the inverted index.
</p>

Learning how analyzers and inverted indexes work helps explain some of the "magic" in Elasticsearch.
In my next Elasticsearch adventure, I will explore querying documents.  All the code from this
article is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2019/10-Oct/10-18-elasticsearch-query">GitHub</a>.

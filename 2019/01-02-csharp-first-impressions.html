I was recently told that my next project at work would be a .NET application using C# in the backend.
C# has been on my radar for a while now, since it supports wide ranging applications such as .NET apps
and Xamarin.  While C# supports multiple programming paradigms, its mostly used for object oriented
programming.  C# is commonly referred to as a descendant of Java and C++<sup>1</sup>, which is great
for me since Java is my strongest language and I'm <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jan-3-2019-cpp-first-impressions">learning C++</a> in parallel with C#.
</p>
<p>
C# is <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#dynamic-&-static-typing">
statically typed</a> with strict type rules (type coercion is rare)<sup>2</sup>.  Programs in C# consist
of executable and library files (with the <strong>.exe</strong> and <strong>.dll</strong> file extensions,
respectively).  C# is a compiled language, just like its ancestors C++ and Java.
</p>
<p>
This article explores my initial reactions to the C# language after writing about 300 lines of code.
Much of the article consists of language features I find cool and unique.  I also compare C# to other
languages I use such as Java.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Similarities to Java">Similarities to Java</SectionTitle>
<p>
The first thing I noticed when writing C# is how similar its syntax looks to Java.  For example, the
first class I wrote represents a song.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
using System;

namespace Application
{
  internal class Song
  {
    private string artist;
    private string name;
    private DateTime releaseDate;
    private string bestLyric;

    public Song(string artist, string name, DateTime releaseDate, string bestLyric)
    {
      this.artist = artist;
      this.name = name;
      this.releaseDate = releaseDate;
      this.bestLyric = bestLyric;
    }

    // Override object.ToString()
    public override string ToString()
    {
      return base.ToString() + ": " + artist + " - " + name;
    }
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While namespaces are an influence of C++, the rest of the object looks like a Java POJO.  It even
overrides the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ToString()</code> method from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">object</code>
superclass, which is the same as Java besides for some letter case differences.
</p>
<p>
The main method also looks like Java.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Application
{
  internal class Execute
  {
    // Same main method as Java
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var bound2 = new Song("Kanye West", "Bound 2", DateTime.Parse("08/28/2013"), "the entire song");

      Debug.Assert(bound2.ToString().Equals("ConsoleApplication.Song: Kanye West - Bound 2"));
    }
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While you can write C# code just like Java, there are a bunch of unique features to the language as
well.  One of the differences I noticed early on was the shortened getter/setter syntax, which is
much more elegant than Java.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
class Run
{
  public Run(string title, double? distance, Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; time, DateTime date)
  {
    this.Title = title;
    this.Distance = distance;
    this.Time = time;
    this.Date = date;
  }

  // Shorter property syntax
  public string Title { get; private set; }
  public double? Distance { get; private set; }
  public Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; Time { get; private set; }
  public DateTime Date { get; private set; }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The Java equivalent to this code includes a long list of getter and setter methods.  Java developers
often use libraries such as Lombok to shorten getter/setter syntax, but a <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/dec-7-2017-native-getter-setter">native solution</a> is preferred.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Interesting Features">Interesting Features</SectionTitle>
<p>
One of the newer features in C# is tuples, which are a great way to represent an arbitrary amount
of data.  Tuples are one of my favorite Python features, so I'm glad to see other languages using them.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// C# has support for tuples
var name = ("Andrew", "Jarombek");

// ...and tuples with named items
var info = (name: "Andy", age: 23);

// While strings are reference types in C#, testing them for equality uses the value type '==' syntax
Assert(name.Item1 == "Andrew" && name.Item2 == "Jarombek");
Assert(info.name == "Andy" && info.age == 23);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In C# you can create variable identifiers with the same name as a reserved keyword.  I don't think any 
other languages I use have this feature.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// You can create an identifier with a keyword if its prefixed with '@'
var @int = 5;

Assert(@int == 5);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@</code> token isn't part of the identifier, and can be
removed if the name isn't a reserved keyword<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
C# also provides two different behaviors for numeric overflows.  Depending on whether the code block
is checked or unchecked, numeric overflows throw an exception or wrap the value, respectively.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">

// My C# execution config throws an OverflowException by default for number overflows.  Use an 'unchecked'
// block to change this behavior.
Assert(unchecked(int.MaxValue + 1) == int.MinValue);

// Wrap the value around if a number overflows its max or min value.
unchecked
{
  var minValue = int.MaxValue + 1;
  var maxValue = int.MinValue - 1;

  Assert(maxValue == int.MaxValue && minValue == int.MinValue);

  // If you want an OverflowException to be thrown when a number overflows (or a compile time error),
  // use a 'checked' block
  Assert(checked(5 + 5 == 10));

  // This code won't compile
  // checked(int.MaxValue + 1);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
C# provides string interpolation syntax and multi-line strings, both of which are common in modern
languages such as JavaScript, Swift, and Groovy.  These features are notably absent in Java and C++.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Strings prefixed with '@' do not have escape sequences
var url1 = "https:\\\\jarombek.com";
var url2 = @"https:\\jarombek.com";

// Strings prefixed with '$' are interpolated strings
var url3 = $"https:\\\\{name.Item2.ToLower()}.com";
var url4 = $@"https:\\{name.Item2.ToLower()}.com";

foreach (var url in new string[] {url1, url2, url3, url4})
{
  Assert(url == @"https:\\jarombek.com");
}

var multiLine = @"
  Hi there.
  My name is Andy.
";
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
C# adds more features to arrays from C++ and Java.  For example, C# provides two types of multi-dimensional
arrays: rectangular and jagged.  Rectangular arrays must be the same length in each dimension, while
jagged arrays can be different lengths in the inner dimension.  While C# has explicit syntax to enforce
rectangular arrays, <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2019/01-Jan/
01-02-csharp-first-impressions/basics/MultiArrays.java">Java has no such enforcement</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// C# supports both rectangular multidimensional arrays ...
// (rectangular arrays sizes are strictly enforced)
int[,] rectangularArray =
{
  {1, 2},
  {3, 4}
};

// and jagged multidimensional arrays
int[][] jaggedArray =
{
  new int[] {1, 2},
  new int[] {3, 4, 5},
};

Assert(!rectangularArray.Equals(jaggedArray));
Assert(rectangularArray[1,1] == jaggedArray[1][1]);
Assert(jaggedArray[1][2] == 5);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
By default, variables are passed to functions by value in C# such that value-types are passed as a copy
of the value and reference-types are passed as a copy of the reference.  Pass by value behavior can be
changed to pass by reference with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ref</code> keyword.  In C++
this behavior requires the use of pointers.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Increment an integer (pass by value).
static int Inc(int num)
{
  return num++;
}

// Increment an integer (pass by reference).
static int IncRef(ref int num)
{
  return num++;
}

public static void Main(params string[] args)
{
  var num = 26;

  // Inc() doesn't mutate num, and returns the new value
  var num2 = Inc(num);

  Assert(num == 26);
  Assert(num2 == 27);

  // IncRef() mutates num
  var num3 = IncRef(ref num);

  Assert(num == 27);
  Assert(num3 == 27);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Function parameters can also use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">out</code> keyword to
declare an output parameter.  Output parameters are used to return multiple values from a function.
Although I think tuples are a more elegant solution, output variables are also a viable option.
The only other language I can think of that uses output parameters is <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2019/01-Jan/01-02-csharp-first-impressions/basics/output-parameter.sql">PL/SQL</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
// Information about the class using output parameters
static void Info(out string author, out DateTime date)
{
  author = "Andrew Jarombek";
  date = DateTime.Parse("12/23/2018");
}

// 'params' keyword allows for a variable number of arguments
public static void Main(params string[] args)
{
  // Call a method with output arguments.  Use a discard '_' to ignore certain output arguments.
  Info(out string author, out _);

  Assert(author == "Andrew Jarombek");
}

</CodeSnippet>
<p>
C# also has operator level support for dealing with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">null</code> values.
The null-coalescing and null-conditional operators present in C# are some of the most useful operators
found in modern languages (<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2019/
01-Jan/01-02-csharp-first-impressions/basics/null.swift">Swift</a> and <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2019/01-Jan/01-02-csharp-first-impressions/basics/null.php">PHP</a>
also have these operators).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C#">
int? age = null;

// Null coalescing operator
double ageDouble = age ?? 0.0;
Assert(ageDouble == 0.0);

// Null conditional operator and null coalescing operator
string ageStr = age?.ToString() ?? "Unknown";
Assert(ageStr == "Unknown");

string username = null;

// Avoid NullReferenceException with null conditional operator
var upperUsername = username?.ToUpper();

Assert(upperUsername == null);
</CodeSnippet>

While C# is influenced by Java and C++, it also includes many modern operations that I appreciate
about languages such as Python, Swift, and Groovy.  I'm excited to learn more of what C# has
to offer in the future.  All the code from this post is available on

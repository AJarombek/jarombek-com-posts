Back in the summer I wrote an article about <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-31-2018-batch-scripting">
Batch scripting</a> on Windows.  In today's article, I'm looking at Bash scripting.  I've used Bash
quite a bit recently.  At work I've used Bash scripts to automate the conversion of Subversion repositories to Git.
In my personal work I've used Bash scripts to assist setting up AWS infrastructure.  The rest of this article
explores basic Bash features and how they compare to Batch.

<p>
Bash stands for <strong>B</strong>ourne-<strong>A</strong>gain <strong>SH</strong>ell, and is derived from the original Bourne shell<sup>1</sup>.  The Bourne
shell was distributed with Unix operating systems starting in 1979, written by Stephen Bourne in Bell
Labs<sup>2</sup>.  Bash began replacing the original Bourne shell in 1989<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Bash is a command line scripting language originally used on Unix-like operating systems.  Nowadays, Bash is
found on most major operating systems, including Linux distributions, MacOS, and Windows 10.
Bash commands are written from a terminal or collected into a script.  Today I'm exploring the creation of
Bash scripts.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Bash File Basics">Bash File Basics</SectionTitle>
<p>
Bash scripts have the file extension <strong>.sh</strong>.  A typical bash file begins with a
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-26-2018-nodejs-command-line#shebang-line">shebang line</a> pointing
to the bash interpreter.  Script input arguments are handled with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">$&lt;argument-number&gt;</code> syntax.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "The first argument passed: $1"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Assigning values to variables is very simple in Bash.  It's equally simple to use these variables in
future commands.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Name="Andrew Jarombek"
echo ${Name}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">${...}</code> syntax is called a parameter expansion.  Parameter
expansions are used to substitute variables or expressions with their values.  Therefore
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">echo ${Name}</code> is substituted with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
echo "Andrew Jarombek"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly Bash variables are untyped (unlike most programming languages I use).  This has interesting
consequences which I'll explore in a future post.  Bash variables contain character strings
which are used in different ways depending on the context<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Parameter expansions can manipulate existing variables.  The following examples alter the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Name</code> variable.  In this context <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Name</code> is a string.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Name="Andrew Jarombek"

# Extract the characters after index 7
LastName=${Name:7}
echo ${LastName}  # "Jarombek"

# Extract the characters from index 0 to index 6
FirstName=${Name:0:6}
echo ${FirstName}  # "Andrew"

# Replace Jarombek with Jarbek
AltName=${Name/Jarombek/Jarbek}
echo ${AltName}  # "Andrew Jarbek"
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In some contexts, variables can represent integers.  In the following example, an arithmetic substitution
is used to create an integer context.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Age=23
AgeInTenYears=$(($Age + 10))
echo ${AgeInTenYears}  # 33
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">$((...))</code> syntax creates an arithmetic substitution<sup>5</sup>.
There are other ways to create integer contexts for performing arithmetic, including backticks and the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">let</code> construct<sup>6</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Bash also has an easy construct for creating functions.  This is much improved from the hacky labeling
and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">call</code> statements in Batch.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
Age=23

func() {
  Age=24
  echo ${Age}
}

# Prints: 24
func
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
One interesting aspect of Bash functions is that variables defined in functions leak into the global
scope.  Luckily if this is not what you intend, there are keywords for altering this behavior.
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">local</code> keyword defines a variable scoped to the function.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
func2() {
  Global="Global Variable"
  local Local="Local Variable"

  # Both global and local print
  echo "${Global}, ${Local}"
}

func2

# Only global prints
echo "${Global}, ${Local}"
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Global Variable, Local Variable
Global Variable,
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As you can see, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Local</code> is not accessible outside the function.
</p>
<p>
Arrays are also available in Bash.  They are simpler than their Batch equivalents because complicated
delayed expansion logic isn't needed.  Bash also provides associative arrays in newer versions.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Create an array and assign values to indices
Towns=()
Towns[0]=Greenwich
Towns[1]="New Canaan"
Towns[2]=Darien
Towns[3]=Wilton
Towns[4]=Ridgefield

echo ${Towns[0]}

# Bash also has associative arrays (These only work in Bash Version 4)
declare -A SkiLocations=([sat]="Catamount" [sun]="Jiminy Peak")
echo ${SkiLocations[sat]}

# Create an array of integers
NumberList=(1 2 3 4 5)

# Get all the items from NumberList
echo ${NumberList[*]}
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Greenwich
Catamount
1 2 3 4 5
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Bash also has simple <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">if</code> statements:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Accumulate all of the strings in the town list
for i in ${NumberList[*]}
do
  AllTowns="${AllTowns} ${Towns[$((i - 1))]}"
done

echo ${AllTowns}

# Accumulate some of the strings in the town list
for i in 2 4
do
  SomeTowns="${SomeTowns} ${Towns[$((i - 1))]}"
done

echo ${SomeTowns}

# Create a unix timestamp of a date on MacOS
DateWritten=$(date -j -f "%F" 2019-01-28 +"%s")
MonthsEnd=$(date -j -f "%F" 2019-01-31 +"%s")

if [ ${DateWritten} -lt ${MonthsEnd} ]
then
  echo "Date is before Jan. 31st, 2019"
else
  echo "Date is equal to or after Jan. 31st, 2019"
fi
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet>
Greenwich New Canaan Darien Wilton Ridgefield
New Canaan Wilton
Date is before Jan. 31st, 2019
</CodeSnippet>

I really enjoy working with Bash due to its simplicity.  It's commands are short and easy to use,
with common utilities such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">echo</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
cat</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">grep</code>, <code>head</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">tail</code> being good examples.  I much prefer it over Batch
scripting.  You can check out more Bash code on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/

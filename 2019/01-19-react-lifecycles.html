In a previous article I looked at <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/nov-24-2018-angular-lifecycles">
lifecycles in the Angular framework</a>.  This post looks at lifecycles in
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=react&page=1">React</a>, a front-end library first released
in 2013 by Facebook (after AngularJS and before <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=angular&page=1">Angular</a>).
If you want to learn more about React, I've written multiple posts about it in the past (including an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-31-2018-react-seed">introduction to the basics</a>).
</p>
<p>
I enjoy working in React more than Angular nowadays.  React feels simpler for developing
website components.  As this post reveals, the lifecycles of React components are equally simple.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Differences between React and Angular Lifecycles">Differences between React and Angular Lifecycles</SectionTitle>
<p>
While Angular has <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions#directives">
directives</a> and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-6-2018-angular-5-first-impressions#modules-components">
components</a>, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-31-2018-react-seed#react-component">React
only has components</a>.  Therefore you don't have to worry about directive lifecycles in React.
</p>
<p>
React and Angular handle state differently.  The state of a React application is usually held in a
single root component.  State lives in a property called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code>
and is updated from the components <code className="jarombek-inline-code">setState()</code> method.  Many
components are called <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-31-2018-react-seed#technologylist-component">
functional components</a> because they don't hold state.  If functional components need to change
application state, they delegate the task to the root component.  Functional components don't have
lifecycles, so lifecycle methods are only used in root components holding application state.
</p>
<p>
The state in an Angular application is often distributed amongst many components.  This is due to
different mechanisms of change management and data binding in Angular.  While React uses one-way data
binding, Angular uses two-way data binding.
</p>
<p>
One-way data binding is when changes to application state only occur in a components code.  Application
state does not change when DOM events occur, however DOM events can trigger code that changes application
state.  In React, functional components can be provided callback functions to change state in the root component.
These functions often respond to DOM events such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">onInput</code>
or <code className="jarombek-inline-code">onClick</code>.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data binding is when both component code and DOM events cause application state to change.
In Angular, DOM events often change state in the component, causing more than one component to hold
application state.  Despite differences with two-way data binding, its possible to write stateless
components in Angular as well<sup>1</sup>. Writing stateless Angular components sounds like a
fun thing to try out in the future.  I'll also cover more differences between one and two way data
binding in a future article.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="React Lifecycles">React Lifecycles</SectionTitle>
<p>
React lifecycles are grouped into two distinct categories.  Some lifecycles are invoked during the
component mounting process, while others are invoked as the component updates.  These groupings of
lifecycles are also present in Angular, although the change detection mechanism is different for Angular
updating lifecycles.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Mounting Lifecycles">Mounting Lifecycles</SectionTitle>
<p>
The mounting process is when a React component is added to the DOM.  As we make changes to the virtual
DOM held in memory, React makes sure that the real DOM reflects those changes.  The mounting lifecycles
provide hook methods that occur while React alters the DOM.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="constructor" isCode="true">constructor(props)</SectionTitle>
<p>
The ES6 class constructor for a React component isn't a lifecycle hook method.  However, I included it
in this discussion because it's the first method invoked while a component is mounted<sup>2</sup>.
The main uses of the constructor are to interact with props provided by the parent component and
set the initial component state.  The constructor is the only time a components
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code> property should be modified directly.  All other mutations
should go through the components <code className="jarombek-inline-code">setState()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
When using server-side rendering, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code> property may
already be initialized when the components constructor is invoked on the client side.  This is due
to the components <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentWillMount()</code> lifecycle hook already
executing on the server.  For my website, I simply wrapped my <code className="jarombek-inline-code">state</code>
initializer in a conditional.  This makes sure any state populated during server-side rendering isn't
wiped out by the client.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
class Blog extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // Only set the state to an empty object if the state doesn't already exist -
    // it may have been set on the server side render
    if (!this.state) {
      this.state = {};
    }
  }

  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="getDefaultProps and getInitialState">
<code className="jarombek-header-code">getDefaultProps()</code> and <code className="jarombek-header-code">getInitialState()</code>
</SectionTitle>
<p>
While React components using ES6 classes have constructors, pre-ES6 code can't utilize this syntax feature.
The alternative to an ES6 class is the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">createReactClass()</code> method from the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">create-react-class</code> npm module.  Prior to React 15.5.0,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createClass()</code> served the same purpose as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">createReactClass()</code>.  Nowadays
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">React.createClass()</code> is deprecated and pending removal.
</p>
<p>
Since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">createReactClass()</code> can't contain a constructor, the
methods <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDefaultProps()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getInitialState()</code> are used as replacements.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDefaultProps()</code>
defines the default property values for the component (if properties aren't passed in).
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getInitialState()</code> serves the main purpose of the constructor -
setting the components initial state.
</p>
<p>
The following code snippet demonstrates <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDefaultProps()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getInitialState()</code> inside <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
createReactClass()</code>.  The full component code is on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/
blob/master/2019/01-Jan/01-19-react-lifecycles/react/lifecycle-demo/src/Lifecycle2.js">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const Lifecycle = createReactClass({
  getDefaultProps() {
    return {
      component: 'Unknown'
    };
  },
  getInitialState() {
    return {};
  },
  ...
});
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="componentWillMount" isCode="true">componentWillMount()</SectionTitle>
<p>
Once the constructor finishes executing, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentWillMount()</code> is
invoked.  This occurs when the component is about to mount onto the DOM.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
componentWillMount()</code> is a good place to perform additional setup for the component (such as
background tasks).  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentWillMount()</code> is also invoked on the server when using server-side rendering.
Therefore any component state initialized in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentWillMount()
</code> on the server is passed to the client when the webpage loads.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="render" isCode="true">render()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> is the most important method of a React component.
In fact, functional components are basically a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code>
method.  The purpose of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> is to render React elements
that make up a component onto the DOM.  In most cases React elements are represented with JSX.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="componentDidMount" isCode="true">componentDidMount()</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentDidMount()</code> is invoked right after the component is
rendered on the DOM.  This is a good place to make API calls or interact with JavaScript global objects
specific to the webpage (such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">window</code>).  It's also an ideal
location to use third-party libraries that need access to the DOM, such as <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/nov-7-2018-react-d3-pt1">D3 for data visualizations</a>.  Since <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
componentDidMount()</code> occurs after the component exists in the DOM, it can't be invoked on the
server with server-side rendering.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentDidMount()</code>
is a safe location to hold client specific code.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="componentWillUnmount" isCode="true">componentWillUnmount()</SectionTitle>
<p>
When a React component is about to be removed from the DOM, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
componentWillUnmount()</code> is invoked.  This is a good place to perform necessary cleanup work
for the component.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Updating Lifecycles">Updating Lifecycles</SectionTitle>
<p>
The component update process occurs when the change detection mechanism determines the component
needs to be altered.  Components are updated whenever the state changes or the properties passed from
the parent component change<sup>3</sup>.  State changes occur when the components
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">setState()</code> method is invoked.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="componentWillReceiveProps" isCode="true">componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)</SectionTitle>
<p>
Invoked if new properties are passed to a component.  Its okay to call <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
setState()</code> from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">componentWillReceiveProps()</code>, making
it unique amongst updating lifecycle methods.  Invoking <code className="jarombek-inline-code">setState()</code>
in the other updating lifecycles results in an infinite loop.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="shouldComponentUpdate" isCode="true">shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)</SectionTitle>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">shouldComponentUpdate()</code> determines whether a component update
should occur.  When it returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code> the component updates
in the DOM.  When it returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">false</code> the update is called
off, avoiding an expensive DOM alteration.  This makes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
shouldComponentUpdate()</code> a good optimization technique to avoid unnecessary component updates.
</p>
<p>
While Angular has no direct equivalent to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">shouldComponentUpdate()</code>,
you can change its change detection mechanism.  By default, Angular checks if any DOM events occur or
values used in the component template are mutated<sup>4</sup>.  This behavior is changed with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> change detection mechanism.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">OnPush</code> checks if object references to template values are
changed (among other differences), resulting in simple mutations not triggering the change detection mechanism<sup>5</sup>.
You can learn more about the differences between Angulars two change detection mechanisms in my
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-12-2019-angular-onpush">discovery post</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="componentWillUpdate" isCode="true">componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)</SectionTitle>
<p>
Invoked right before the component updates.  This is a good location to compare the incoming properties
and state to the ones currently in the component.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="componentDidUpdate" isCode="true">componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)</SectionTitle>
<p>
Invoked right after the component updates.  This is a good location to compare the old properties
and state to the ones currently in the component.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Lifecycle Project">Lifecycle Project</SectionTitle>
<p>
I created a project in React which displays a new component each time an App lifecycle is invoked.
It also demonstrates how <code className="jarombek-inline-code">shouldComponentUpdate()</code> can avoid
unnecessary DOM alterations.  The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/
tree/master/2019/01-Jan/01-19-react-lifecycles/react">GitHub</a>.

I really enjoy comparing React and Angular.  While most of my development
these days is in React, comparing it to other major front-end libraries/frameworks is a good practice!
  Understanding how lifecycle events work in Angular and React is important for developing good applications.

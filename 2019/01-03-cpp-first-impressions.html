C++ is a language I've always wanted to learn.  So many modern languages are influenced by C++ and
their designs are often predicated upon the strengths and weaknesses of C++.  For example, I recently
wrote about how interfaces and the lack of multiple inheritance in Java is <a href="https://jarombek.com/
blog/dec-22-2018-multiple-inheritance#c++">due to C++</a>.
</p>
<p>
C++ is a low level language closely related to the C programming language.  Originally called
"C with Classes," C++ added object oriented concepts on top of C<sup>1</sup>.  In most cases C++ is
still a true superset of C.  One of the main design philosophies of C++ was to make it so low level that
no language would be needed below it<sup>2</sup>.  Because of this philosophy, C++ is commonly used for
low-level tasks such as system programming.  However, being low-level causes C++ to contain some complexities.
</p>
<p>
This post is my first impressions of C++.  I compare it to other languages such as C and Java, since
C influenced C++ and Java was influenced by C++.  I also mention all the basic C++ features that I
find interesting.
</p>

<p>
When first writing C++, the similarities to C are immediately apparent.  However, C++ does add new
syntax which can be used on top of the traditional C syntax.  For example, C++ adds a new variable
initialization expression to complement the existing C expression.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// C++ initialization notations
int age = 23;
double programming_experience {2.5};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
C++ has some modern syntax as well.  For example, types don't need to be explicitly declared with the help of
the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">auto</code> keyword.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">auto</code>
is similar to <code class="jarombek-inline-code">var</code> in Java and C# (note: all these languages
are still <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jul-15-2018-groovy-optional-typing#dynamic-&-static-typing">
statically typed</a>).
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// 'auto' is used to not explicitly state the type of a variable (like 'var' in C# and Java)
auto percentage_programming = programming_experience / age;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Just like C, you can define constant variables with the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">const</code>
keyword.  C++ adds the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">constexpr</code> keyword, which defines an
expression or function that is evaluated at compile time<sup>3</sup>.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">
constexpr</code> functions must be pure functions that only handle immutable variables.  I created a
compile time function that calculates the mile pace of a run.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// A 'constexpr' is evaluated at compile time.  The arguments to this function must be constant
// (as defined with 'const')
constexpr double pace(double miles, int minutes, int seconds)
{
  return ((minutes * 60) + seconds) / miles;
}

int main()
{
  const auto miles = 2;
  const auto minutes = 12;
  const auto seconds = 31;

  // Invoke a 'constexpr' function with 'const' arguments
  auto run_pace = pace(miles, minutes, seconds);
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">constexpr</code> in C++ was likely influenced by functional
programming.  Creating compile time functions is also possible in Haskell, a
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-6-2018-haskell-pt1">functional programming language</a>
<sup>4</sup>.  You can check out the Haskell code on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com-sources/tree/master/2019/01-Jan/01-03-cpp-first-impressions/haskell">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
Compile time functions are commonly used as a performance strategy.  We can prove
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">pace()</code> executes at compile time by using
static assertions.  Static assertions are just like regular assertions except executed at compile
time instead of runtime.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// This is valid because pace() is a 'constexpr' function, so it is evaluated at compile time
static_assert(pace(miles, minutes, seconds) == 375.5);

static_assert(sizeof(float) == 4);
static_assert(sizeof(double) == 8);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Static assertions are a really cool language feature that I've never seen before.  The greatest
thing about them is how IDEs check if they pass in the code itself.
</p>
<p>
C++ also adds additional pointer functionality to the C model.  While you can still use pointers
just like in C, there is an additional "references to" operator specified with the unary suffix
<code class="jarombek-inline-code">&</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="C++">
// Basic pointers are the same as C
int minutes[] = {95, 85, 15, 110, 160, 105, -1};
int* minp = &minutes[5];

assert(*minp == 105);

// C++ also supplies a unary suffix '&'.  It is similar to a pointer as it "references to" a memory location.
// '&' differs from a pointer because it doesn't need to be prefixed with '*' to get its value.
int& minr = minutes[6];

assert(minr == -1);

Anyone who's heard of C++ but never used it usually thinks its an object oriented
version of C.  This assumption is true, as C++ provides an enhanced custom type system with classes.
I decided to create an API for a running exercise in both C++ and C.  This example demonstrates some
differences between the two languages.

The C++ version uses a class to encapsulate the run information and available methods.

I'm really excited to continue learning C++ and see how it influenced all the languages I use on
a daily basis.  All the code from this article is available on <a href="https://github.com/

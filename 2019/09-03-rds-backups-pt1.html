When working with Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) or any other database, creating backups of
your data is an important safety precaution.  The data of an application is often its most important
asset, and if its lost or damaged the app is rendered useless.  With RDS, Amazon provides a backup mechanism called
snapshots.  Snapshots backup the database instance and allow users to restore their RDS instance from a
snapshot<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Internally snapshots are stored in an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket.  However, these backups
aren't accessible through S3, since the bucket is hidden from the users AWS account<sup>2</sup>.  The only
way to see snapshots is through the RDS service.  Also, snapshots aren't downloadable and their contents
can't be viewed.  This poses some serious limitations when trying to test a database backup.

<p>
Due to the limitations of snapshots, custom solutions for RDS backups are often required.  In this series of
articles, I'm going to create an automated mechanism for backing up RDS instances.  My approach uses an AWS
Lambda function and the mysqldump command line utility to store MySQL database backup files on Amazon S3.
</p>
<p>
This lambda function is currently in use for my <a href="https://www.saintsxctf.com">SaintsXCTF</a> website.
In this article I'll discuss the AWS infrastructure around my SaintsXCTF RDS database, which helps give context
for the design choices I made.  In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-5-2019-rds-backups-pt2">next
 article</a> I'll discuss the code required to create the lambda function.

<SectionTitle title="Infrastructure Overview">Infrastructure Overview</SectionTitle>
<p>
At a high level, the SaintsXCTF application lives in a single VPC inside my AWS account.  My VPC has four subnets,
two which are private and which that are public.
</p>
<Definition word="VPC">
A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private cloud with its own IP address range, providing a network for cloud
resources.  VPCs are a good way to create isolation between different applications or environments in a cloud
infrastructure account<sup>3</sup>.  Within a VPC, IP addresses are further partitioned into subnetworks (subnets).
</Definition>
<Definition word="Subnet">
A subnet (subnetwork) is a subsection of an IP address range.  Subnets provide a way to partition IP addresses into
groups.  In AWS, a subnet within a VPC can either be publically accessible to the internet or private to the subnetwork.
</Definition>
<p>
Here's an infrastructure diagram for my VPC and subnets:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The web application for SaintsXCTF lives on an EC2 instance behind a load balancer in the public subnets.  The RDS
MySQL database is highly available and lives in the private subnets.  Since the database exists in a private
subnet, only resources within the VPC are able to access it.  Any IP addresses located elsewhere on the internet are blocked
from reaching it.  This is great for security, since only the web application in the public subnet should access
the database.  However, it makes the process of automating database backups a bit trickier (as we will soon see).
</p>
<p>
Here is an updated infrastructure diagram with the web application and database:

All my infrastructure for SaintsXCTF is written as code using Terraform.  You can check out the IaC for the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/web-server">web server</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/database">database</a> on GitHub.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Infrastructure for Database Backups">Infrastructure for Database Backups</SectionTitle>
<p>
The first piece of infrastructure needed to automate database backups is a lambda function.  Since the lambda
function needs access to a database in a private subnet, it must be located within the applications VPC.
</p>
<p>
The second piece of infrastructure needed is a S3 bucket to store the SQL files containing database backups.
While S3 buckets are assigned regions, they can't be placed within a VPC.  S3 buckets can be described as a
global resource within the cloud infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The third piece of infrastructure needed is Amazon Secrets Manager.  With Secrets Manager I'm able to securely store
 the database username and password.  Thanks to Secrets Manager my database credentials aren't hard-coded within the lambda
function.  Just like S3, Secrets Manager is assigned a region but not a VPC.
</p>
<p>
With these three new pieces of infrastructure outlined, I drafted a new infrastructure diagram:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/9-3-19-saints-xctf-infra-diagram-3.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, this diagram still has some missing pieces.  I quickly learned that placing an AWS Lambda function
within a VPC causes some complications.  Since I placed the lambda function within the VPC to connect
to the database, it no longer had internet access.  This is the default behavior of lambda functions within a VPC<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While my lambda function was still able to connect to the RDS instance, it lost connection to Secrets Manager
and the S3 bucket.  RDS connections still worked because the lambda function and database existed in the same
 VPC.  Because of this I could utilize the database's private IP address instead of its public one.  However,
S3 and Secrets Manager didn't exist in my applications VPC.  Therefore the only way to connect to them was over
the internet.
</p>
<p>
There are two solutions to this problem.  One is to set up network address translation (NAT) in the private subnet.
The other is to create VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager and S3.  I really wanted to avoid using NAT because it
costs $0.045 per hour, which is very expensive for my personal use.  Therefore I went with the VPC endpoint approach.
VPC endpoints allow for resources within a VPC to connect to other AWS resources without needing internet access<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
With the VPC endpoints in place, here is the final infrastructure diagram:

This article gave a high-level overview of my AWS infrastructure and the new parts needed to automate
database backups.  In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-5-2019-rds-backups-pt2">next article</a>, I'll
implement these new pieces of infrastructure and go over the AWS Lambda function which lives at the heart of the
backup process.

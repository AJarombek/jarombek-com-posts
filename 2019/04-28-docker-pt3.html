In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/apr-1-2019-docker-pt1">previous</a> <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
apr-8-2019-docker-pt2">two</a> Docker articles, I explored the container environment basics and created
a playground to run Docker on AWS.  In this article, I’m creating a containerized application that
is publicly accessible from the internet.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Containerizing a Node.js Application">Containerizing a Node.js Application</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Containerized Application">
A software application which is running inside a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
apr-1-2019-docker-pt1#container">container</a>.  Configuring an application to run inside a container
is known as "containerizing an application.<sup>1</sup>"  This process usually includes creating a
Dockerfile in the root directory of an application repository.  Dockerfiles are blueprints for building
Docker images, and commonly declare application dependencies and execution processes<sup>2</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
The first thing needed before containerizing an application is the application itself.  I created a
basic <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=node.js&page=1">Node.js</a> application which prints out
some JSON.  It consists of a single <strong>main.js</strong> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// main.js

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.port || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({title: 'Dockerized Node.js App'});
});

module.exports = app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Started Containerized App on Port ${port}`);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the Node.js application in place, I created a Dockerfile which configures a container to run the
<strong>main.js</strong> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Dockerfile">
# Dockerfile

# The 'FROM' instruction defines the base layer of the image.
# This image uses the Alpine Linux distro as the base image.
FROM alpine

# The 'LABEL' instruction is used to add metadata about the image.
LABEL maintainer="andrew@jarombek.com"

# The 'RUN' instruction adds a new layer to an image.  It executes commands on the image.
RUN apk add --update nodejs nodejs-npm

# The 'COPY' instruction copies files in the build context onto the image
COPY . /src

# The 'WORKDIR' instruction sets the directory to execute the remaining commands from
WORKDIR /src

# Install npm inside the /src directory
RUN npm install

# The 'EXPOSE' instruction determines which port is exposed for the containerized application
EXPOSE 3000

# The 'ENTRYPOINT' instruction declares the main application that the container runs
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./main.js"]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As previously mentioned, a Dockerfile is a blueprint for an image.  A container is a running image.
The Dockerfile for my application begins by building on top of the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code>
image.  <code class="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code> is an extremely small Docker image based
on the Alpine Linux distribution.  On top of the Alpine OS, I install Node.js and the application npm
dependencies.  Finally I declare the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">node</code> process that
runs on the container in the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">ENTRYPOINT</code> instruction.
</p>
<p>
Now it’s time to containerize the application in the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/apr-8-2019-docker-pt2">
Docker playground</a> I built in my previous post.  The first steps are connecting to the playground EC2
instance and cloning the Git repository which contains the Node.js application.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Connect to Docker Playground EC2
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

git clone https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes.git
cd devops-prototypes/docker/nodejs-docker-app/
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the Node.js application on the EC2 instance, it’s time to containerize the application using Docker.
The following command does the trick:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker image build -t nodejs-docker-app:latest .
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The final dot (<code class="jarombek-inline-code">.</code>) in this command is important since it tells
Docker to build an image based on the Dockerfile in the current directory.  List all the Docker images
to confirm that a new <code class="jarombek-inline-code">nodejs-docker-app</code> image exists.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker image ls

# REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
# nodejs-docker-app   latest              1510b5182aaa        2 seconds ago       50.3MB
# alpine              latest              cdf98d1859c1        6 days ago          5.53MB
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice there is also an <code class="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code> image.  This is pulled from
DockerHub during the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">FROM alpine</code> instruction of my Dockerfile.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to start a Docker container from the <code class="jarombek-inline-code">nodejs-docker-app</code> image.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker container run -d --name nodejs-app -p 80:3000 nodejs-docker-app:latest
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Confirm the container is running by listing the containers with <code class="jarombek-inline-code">docker
container ls</code>.  The application is now running in a container on port 3000 and accessible from the
Docker playground EC2 instance on port 80.  Using the public DNS name of the EC2 instance, the application
is viewable from a web browser.

<p>
While this is a very basic application, the same containerizing process can be used for complex pieces
of software.  In a production system, you won’t just run a single container.  Replicas will be created
through a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.  Kubernetes will be the topic of
future articles since I’ve been using it extensively lately.  All the code from this article is available
on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/tree/master/docker/nodejs-docker-app">GitHub</a>.

In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/apr-1-2019-docker-pt1">previous</a> <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
apr-8-2019-docker-pt2">two</a> Docker articles, I explored container environment basics and created
a playground to run Docker on AWS.  In this article, I'm creating a containerized application that
is publicly accessible from the internet.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Containerizing a Node.js Application">Containerizing a Node.js Application</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="Containerized Application">
A software application which is running inside a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
apr-1-2019-docker-pt1#container">container</a>.  Configuring an application to run inside a container
is known as "containerizing an application.<sup>1</sup>"  This process usually includes creating a
Dockerfile in the root directory of an application repository.  Dockerfiles are blueprints for building
Docker images, and commonly declare application dependencies and execution processes<sup>2</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
The first thing needed before containerizing an application is the application itself.  I created a
basic <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=node.js&page=1">Node.js</a> application which prints out
some JSON.  It consists of a single <strong>main.js</strong> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
// main.js

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.port || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({title: 'Dockerized Node.js App'});
});

module.exports = app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Started Containerized App on Port ${port}`);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the Node.js application in place, I created a Dockerfile which configures a container to run the
<strong>main.js</strong> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Dockerfile">
# Dockerfile

# The 'FROM' instruction defines the base layer of the image.
# This image uses the Alpine Linux distro as the base image.
FROM alpine

# The 'LABEL' instruction is used to add metadata about the image.
LABEL maintainer="andrew@jarombek.com"

# The 'RUN' instruction adds a new layer to an image.  It executes commands on the image.
RUN apk add --update nodejs nodejs-npm

# The 'COPY' instruction copies files in the build context onto the image
COPY . /src

# The 'WORKDIR' instruction sets the directory to execute the remaining commands from
WORKDIR /src

# Install npm inside the /src directory
RUN npm install

# The 'EXPOSE' instruction determines which port is exposed for the containerized application
EXPOSE 3000

# The 'ENTRYPOINT' instruction declares the main application that the container runs
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./main.js"]
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As previously mentioned, a Dockerfile is a blueprint for an image.  A container is a running image.
The Dockerfile for my application begins by building on top of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code>
image.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code> is an extremely small Docker image based
on the Alpine Linux distribution.  On top of the Alpine OS, I install Node.js and the application npm
dependencies.  Finally I declare the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">node</code> process that
runs on the container in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">ENTRYPOINT</code> instruction.
</p>
<p>
Now it's time to containerize the application in the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/apr-8-2019-docker-pt2">
Docker playground</a> I built in my previous post.  The first steps are connecting to the playground EC2
instance and cloning the Git repository which contains the Node.js application.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
# Connect to Docker Playground EC2
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

git clone https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes.git
cd devops-prototypes/docker/nodejs-docker-app/
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
With the Node.js application on the EC2 instance, it's time to containerize the application using Docker.
The following command does the trick:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker image build -t nodejs-docker-app:latest .
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The final dot (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.</code>) in this command is important since it tells
Docker to build an image based on the Dockerfile in the current directory.  List all the Docker images
to confirm that a new <code className="jarombek-inline-code">nodejs-docker-app</code> image exists.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker image ls

# REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
# nodejs-docker-app   latest              1510b5182aaa        2 seconds ago       50.3MB
# alpine              latest              cdf98d1859c1        6 days ago          5.53MB
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice there is also an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">alpine</code> image.  This is pulled from
DockerHub during the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">FROM alpine</code> instruction of my Dockerfile.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to start a Docker container from the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">nodejs-docker-app</code> image.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Bash">
docker container run -d --name nodejs-app -p 80:3000 nodejs-docker-app:latest
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Confirm the container is running by listing the containers with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">docker
 container ls</code>.  The application is now running in a container on port 3000 and accessible from the
Docker playground EC2 instance on port 80.  Using the public DNS name of the EC2 instance, the application
is viewable from a web browser.

While this is a very basic application, the same containerizing process can be used for complex pieces
of software.  In a production system, you won't just run a single container.  Replicas will be created
through a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.  Kubernetes will be the topic of
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/may-13-2019-kubernetes-pt1">future articles</a> since I've been using it
 extensively lately.  All the code from this article is available
on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/tree/master/docker/nodejs-docker-app">GitHub</a>.

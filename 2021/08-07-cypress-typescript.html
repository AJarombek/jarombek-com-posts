Cypress is an end to end (e2e) testing framework written in JavaScript for front-end applications.  Cypress tests run
in a Chrome web browser or in a headless browser, navigating through and interacting with web pages.  While itâ€™s
reasonable to compare Cypress to other test automation frameworks such as Selenium or Puppeteer, Cypress was created
specifically for writing end to end tests.  Because of its test first design, Cypress provides lots of features that
make writing end to end tests easy.  It is currently my preferred end to end testing tool.

While Cypress tests can be written in JavaScript, as is the case with my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com/tree/master/cypress/integration">jarombek.com</a> application, it also has TypeScript support.  Nowadays,
I write most of my front-end applications in TypeScript due to its type safety.  In my experience, TypeScript helps
reduce the number of bugs and type mismatch mistakes in JavaScript code.  For applications written in TypeScript, it is
great to be able to write Cypress tests in TypeScript as well.  This helps keep the programming language usage uniform
across the front-end application code and test code.

In this article, I discuss the basics of Cypress and how I use it to test my front-end applications.  All the Cypress
test code I show is written in TypeScript.  The Cypress test code comes from two of my application repositories:
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype/tree/master/client/cypress">apollo-client-server-prototype</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/master/cypress">saints-xctf-web</a>.

<Definition word="End to End Testing">
End to end (E2E) testing is the practice of writing tests for an application from one end to another, from beginning to
end.  In essence, these tests cover the entire execution flow of an application in a production-like environment.  In
the case of a front-end application, this means testing the application by interacting with the UI as an actual user
would. Because these tests are executed in a production-like environment, all the API calls used by the front-end code
are invoked as part of the tests.  This results in the application being executed from end to end - from the front-end
to the back-end and database.

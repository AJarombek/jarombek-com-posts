Cypress is an end to end (e2e) testing framework written in JavaScript for front-end applications.  Cypress tests run
in a Chrome web browser or in a headless browser, navigating through and interacting with web pages.  While it’s
reasonable to compare Cypress to other test automation frameworks such as Selenium or Puppeteer, Cypress was created
specifically for writing end to end tests.  Because of its test first design, Cypress provides lots of features that
make writing end to end tests easy.  It is currently my preferred end to end testing tool.

<p>
While Cypress tests can be written in JavaScript, as is the case with my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com/tree/master/cypress/integration">jarombek.com</a> application, it also has TypeScript support.  Nowadays,
I write most of my front-end applications in TypeScript due to its type safety.  In my experience, TypeScript helps
reduce the number of bugs and type mismatch mistakes in JavaScript code.  For applications written in TypeScript, it is
great to be able to write Cypress tests in TypeScript as well.  This helps keep the programming language usage uniform
across the front-end application code and test code.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I discuss the basics of Cypress and how I use it to test my front-end applications.  All the Cypress
test code I show is written in TypeScript.  The Cypress test code comes from two of my application repositories:
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype/tree/master/client/cypress">apollo-client-server-prototype</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/master/cypress">saints-xctf-web</a>.

<Definition word="End to End Testing">
End to end (E2E) testing is the practice of writing tests for an application from one end to another, from beginning to
end.  In essence, these tests cover the entire execution flow of an application in a production-like environment.  In
the case of a front-end application, this means testing the application by interacting with the UI as an actual user
would. Because these tests are executed in a production-like environment, all the API calls used by the front-end code
are invoked as part of the tests.  This results in the application being executed from end to end - from the front-end
to the back-end and database.
</Definition>
<p>
With Cypress, end to end tests are run in a web browser.  Tests navigate to a web page and make assertions about the
content shown.  Then, they can interact with the page and make further assertions about what changed in the UI, check
what network calls were made, and more.

Cypress is installed from its <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress">cypress</a> npm package.  Cypress is
pretty easy to configure with an application.  For example, my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com">saintsxctf.com</a>
application uses Cypress and is configured to use it with TypeScript.  For starters, its repository
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">saints-xctf-web</a> is written as an npm package, with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cypress</code> defined as a dev dependency in its <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/package.json#L77">package.json</a> file.  Next, a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/cypress.json">cypress.json</a> file exists in the root directory of the npm
package.  This is the main configuration file for Cypress, with the contents of my configuration file shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8090",
  "ignoreTestFiles": ["*.md"],
  "env": {
    ...
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although the fields of the configuration file are optional, they do help simplify tests and configure the settings of
Cypress to fit your needs<sup>1</sup>.  In my configuration file, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">baseUrl</code>
configures the default base URL to use for all my tests, so that I don’t need to copy-paste it across all my test cases.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ignoreTestFiles</code> configures the Cypress test runner to ignore any Markdown
files in the test directory, in my case which are used for documentation purposes.  Finally,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">env</code> sets environment variables which are accessible to the Cypress test
code.  Cypress has many additional <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Options">
configuration options</a> listed in their documentation.
</p>
<p>
The actual Cypress test code is written in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/master/cypress">cypress</a>
directory located in the root of the npm package.  The <strong>cypress</strong> folder and its subdirectories are
created as a scaffold automatically when Cypress is first run in the project, so there is no need to create these
manually.  Inside <strong>cypress</strong> are four subdirectories - <strong>fixtures</strong>, <strong>integration</strong>,
<strong>plugins</strong>, and <strong>support</strong> - along with a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/master/cypress/tsconfig.json">tsconfig.json</a> file to configure TypeScript.

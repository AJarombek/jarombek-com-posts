AWS CloudWatch Synthetic Monitoring is a platform that enables the creation of functions that monitor applications or
APIs.  These functions are known as canary functions, and they use AWS Lambda for their infrastructure.  Canary
functions are written in JavaScript or Python.  They utilize Puppeteer (JavaScript) and Selenium (Python) for
browser test automation.
</p>
<p>
I started looking into Synthetic Monitoring as a way to test my SaintsXCTF application running in production.  I had
an issue where the website unexpectedly stopped working, and there was no automated process in place to alert me.
 With Synthetic Monitoring, I created canary functions to test critical paths of the website, such as signing in a user.
 If canary functions fail, I get an email alerting me of the issue.
</p>
<p>
Synthetic Monitoring is a relatively new AWS service, so documentation is a bit lighter when compared to other
services.  Specifically, documentation for building canary functions with Terraform is incomplete with very few code
 samples.  In this article, I give an overview of my Synthetic Monitoring AWS infrastructure and show how it's configured
with Terraform.  I also give a brief walk through of my canary function source code.  All the code mentioned in this
article is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/
synthetic-monitoring">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Canary Function Infrastructure">Canary Function Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
My Synthetic Monitoring infrastructure consists of canary functions, an S3 bucket holding canary function results and
images, and CloudWatch events to notify me via email when a canary function fails.  This infrastructure is shown in the
diagram below.
</p>

<p>
Notice that my infrastructure consists of three canary functions, two written in JavaScript and one written in Python.
All this infrastructure is built with Terraform, separated into three modules.  The first module is for canary
functions and CloudWatch events, the second module is for an S3 bucket holding canary function results, and the third
 module contains an IAM role and policy assumed by the canary function.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Canary Functions and CloudWatch Events">Canary Functions and CloudWatch Events</SubTitle>

The following Terraform code creates one of my canary functions.  This canary function tests the sign in functionality
on my website.  It also sets up a CloudWatch event for sending alerts when the function fails.

There are certain permissions that canary functions must have in their IAM roles<sup>1</sup>.  These permissions are specified in
the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">CanaryGeneric</code> statement of the policy.  My canary functions also
require additional permissions, specifically for AWS Secrets Manager. These permissions are specified in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">CanarySecretsManager</code> statement of the policy.

The source code for canary functions is written in JavaScript or Python.  I used both languages, simply for the
sake of trying all available options.  The runtime environments for both languages are configured with browser test
libraries.  JavaScript functions use Puppeteer while Python functions use Selenium.

First, I will walkthrough one of my functions utilizing JavaScript and Puppeteer, followed by a walkthrough of a
 function utilizing Python and Selenium.

One of my JavaScript canary functions performs a test to see whether a user can sign in to my website.  The source code is shown below,

<p>
This function uses the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">synthetics</code> library, which is imported with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">const synthetics = require('Synthetics')</code>. The synthetics library is a
wrapper around Puppeteer, so reading the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/
CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_WritingCanary_Nodejs.html">AWS Synthetics documentation</a> along with the
<a href="https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v10.1.0&show=outline">Puppeteer documentation</a> is enough to
hit the ground running. Synthetics also has a bunch of
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library_Nodejs.html">
custom functions</a>, such as the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">executeStep()</code> function used in my code.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">executeStep()</code> runs Puppeteer commands and takes screenshots of the
website, which are eventually uploaded to the canary function's S3 bucket.
</p>
<p>
The canary function starts by navigating to the sign in page.  This is performed by the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">page.goto('https://saintsxctf.com/signin')</code> command.  Then, in the four
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">executeStep()</code> functions, it types in credentials to a sign in form
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">'enter_credentials'</code>), clicks the sign in button
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">'sign_in'</code>), clicks on the profile page button once signed in
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">'profile_page_click'</code>), and checks to see if an element appears
 in the profile page (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">'profile_page_view'</code>).
</p>
<p>
This code also shows how canary functions can use the AWS SDK, in this case to grab user credentials from
Secrets Manager.  Secrets Manager helps avoid the bad practice of hard coding credentials into the canary function source code.

Another runtime option for canary functions is Python and the Selenium library.  My Python canary function tests
whether a "forgot password" email can be sent from my website.  The source code is shown below, and exists in a

Synthetic Monitoring canary functions are a nice addition to AWS that allow users to easily create and schedule browser
test code for applications.  In my case, canary functions assist in sending me notifications if critical parts of my
website stop working.  Although documentation is still a bit rough around the edges, I believe canary functions are a
worthwhile option for end to end testing applications running in production environments.  All the source code for this
article is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/synthetic-monitoring">GitHub</a>.

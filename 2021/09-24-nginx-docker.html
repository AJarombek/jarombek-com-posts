Many of my applications contain frontend components and API components.  These two components are loosely coupled but
communicate with each other over HTTPS.  For example, my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a>
application has a React frontend which communicates with a Flask REST API backend, along with other API Gateway REST
APIs.  One way to accomplish communication from a frontend to an API is by explicitly writing the URLs of the APIs
in the frontend code.  This works fine, but it also exposes information about API origin servers to clients.
Origin server information exposure can be avoided by passing all API traffic through the same URL as the frontend
application. This is accomplished using a reverse proxy.
</p>
<p>
The following image shows my SaintsXCTF website, and how the URL of the API is hidden from clients.  If users inspect
the website's network traffic, they see HTTPS requests sent to the reverse proxy server for <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>,
instead of the actual API server <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>.

This article discusses reverse proxy servers, shows examples from my applications, and provides application
source code; allowing you to achieve similar results.  More specifically, it looks at creating Nginx reverse proxies
in Docker containers.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is an Nginx Reverse Proxy">What is an Nginx Reverse Proxy?</SectionTitle>
<p>
When discussing Nginx reverse proxies, there are two distinct technologies to unpack: Nginx and reverse proxies.
</p>
<Definition word="Nginx">
Nginx (pronounced Engine-X) is an open source web server which can be used as a reverse proxy<sup>1</sup>.  It is
commonly used for serving content from HTTP requests, as well as caching and load balancing requests.  Nginx is
comparable in popularity with Apache HTTP Server, which is another open source web server.  Nginx has its own
configuration language, which engineers use to adjust the web server's behavior<sup>2</sup>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Reverse Proxy">
A reverse proxy server sits between a client and one or more backend servers.  Reverse proxy servers intake 
 requests from a client, and appropriately distributes those requests to servers sitting behind it.  When a
 reverse proxy server sends responses from it's backend servers to a client, it does so without alluding to the
existence of backend servers at all.  From the client's perspective, responses originate from the reverse proxy
server itself.  Reverse proxy servers are used to hide backend servers, cache responses, load balance, and more<sup>3</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
Using Nginx's configuration language, servers can be configured as reverse proxy servers.  While these servers can exist
on physical machines or virtual machines, the Nginx servers discussed in this article exist on Docker containers.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Architectural Overview">Architectural Overview</SectionTitle>
<p>
I have multiple applications which use Nginx reverse proxy servers on Docker containers, including the <a href="https://
github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/nginx.conf">SaintsXCTF web application</a>, <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/blob/master/api/src/nginx.conf">SaintsXCTF API</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
apollo-client-server-prototype/blob/master/client/nginx.conf">Apollo client prototype</a>, <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype/blob/master/server/nginx.conf">Apollo server prototype</a>, and <a href="https://
github.com/AJarombek/graphql-react-prototype/blob/master/nginx.conf">GraphQL React prototype</a>.  All these proxy server containers
are orchestrated using Kubernetes and hosted on AWS EKS.  For the remainder of the article, I'll look specifically at
the Nginx configuration for my SaintsXCTF application.  Nginx code from my other applications can be viewed on GitHub
using the links above.
</p>
<p>
The SaintsXCTF application has two Nginx reverse proxies, one for the web application and one for the main API.  The
application also has smaller APIs which are hosted using AWS API Gateway.  As I mentioned earlier, the Nginx reverse
proxies are hosted on Docker containers orchestrated on Kubernetes.  My Kubernetes infrastructure is hosted on an AWS
EKS cluster in my AWS account.  Below is an infrastructure diagram showing the reverse proxy servers.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/9-24-21-reverse-proxy-infrastructure.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The web application Kubernetes deployment consists of a single container running an Nginx server.  The API Kubernetes
deployment consists of two containers: an Nginx server and a uWSGI server.  For the API, the Nginx server is the
reverse proxy server and the uWSGI server is the application server, hosting the Python/Flask API.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Configuring Nginx Docker Containers">Configuring Nginx Docker Containers</SectionTitle>
<p>
Let's look at the Docker and Nginx configurations for these containers, back to front; starting with the uWSGI container
for the API code.  The two important configuration files for the uWSGI container are a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/blob/master/api/src/api.flask.dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/blob/master/api/src/uwsgi.ini">uwsgi.ini</a> file.

</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Don't get bogged down by the details of the Dockerfile; the important takeaway is that it installs uWSGI with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">pip install uwsgi</code> and starts the uWSGI application server with the
configuration specified in <strong>uwsgi.ini</strong>.  It does so using the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
CMD ["uwsgi", "--ini", "uwsgi.ini"]</code> entrypoint.
</p>
<p>
The uWSGI configuration file is configured to open a socket on port <strong>5000</strong> for incoming requests.  These
requests are passed from the Nginx reverse proxy server<sup>4</sup>.  The Nginx container for the API has two important
configuration files: the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/blob/master/api/src/
api.nginx.dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> and an <a href="">nginx.conf</a> file.

<p>
The important parts of the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> are the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">RUN</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">COPY</code> commands.  These commands delete the default Nginx configuration
and add the custom Nginx configuration, respectively.  The custom Nginx configuration exists in the
<strong>nginx.conf</strong> file.
</p>
<p>
In the Nginx configuration, the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">server</code> block creates a virtual server,
which in my case is a reverse proxy server<sup>5</sup>.  Inside the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">server</code>
block are two <code className="jarombek-inline-code">location</code> blocks; each location determines what actions occur
when incoming requests are made to certain URLs<sup>6</sup>.  The remaining configuration is a standard Flask/uWSGI
Nginx setup found in the Flask <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/uwsgi/#configuring-nginx">
documentation</a><sup>7</sup>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">uwsgi_pass</code> directive makes the Nginx
server a reverse proxy server that proxies requests to the uWSGI application server located at
<strong>saints-xctf-api-flask:5000</strong>.  This URL is the DNS location of the uWSGI Docker container on my
Kubernetes cluster.
</p>
<p>
With the uWSGI and Nginx containers created, the infrastructure for my API is in place.  The Docker containers are
configured to run locally with Docker Compose in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-api/blob/master/
infra/docker-compose/docker-compose-api.yml">docker-compose-api.yml</a> file and in production with Kubernetes in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-api/modules/kubernetes/
main.tf">main.tf</a> file.
</p>
<p>
The web application infrastructure consists of a single Nginx Docker container.  The two important configuration files
for the web application container are a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/
app.dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/nginx.conf">

<p>
The <strong>Dockerfile</strong> for the web application should look similar to the Nginx Dockerfile for the API.  The
differences include the use of a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/base.dockerfile">
base image</a> which installs npm dependencies using yarn, the creation of JavaScript bundles for the frontend
application via <code className="jarombek-inline-code">RUN yarn build</code>, and JavaScript bundles being copied from
the base image to the Nginx image via <code className="jarombek-inline-code">COPY --from=base /src/dist /usr/share/nginx/html</code>.
</p>
<p>
The Nginx reverse proxy server configuration for the web application is a bit more complex. The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">server</code> block for the web application has many
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">location</code> blocks.  The first <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
location</code> block serves the React.js web application, while each subsequent block proxies requests to different
backend servers.  These proxies use <code className="jarombek-inline-code">proxy_pass</code> directives instead of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">uwsgi_pass</code> directives, since the backend servers are simple HTTPS servers
instead of uWSGI applciation servers<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Similar to the API, the web application is configured to run in production with Kubernetes in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com/modules/kubernetes/main.tf">main.tf</a> file.  Instead
of using Docker Compose locally like the API, the web application configures a local reverse proxy using webpack dev server<sup>9</sup>.
The configuration for webpack dev server exists in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/
webpack.config.js#L116-L155">webpack.config.js</a> file.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Reverse proxy servers are a great way to hide backend server locations from end users.  I also find them very elegant,
as they remove the need to hardcode server URLs in application code.  Code for the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web">web application</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-api">API</a> referenced
throughout this article is available on GitHub.

When it comes to CSS preprocessors (stylesheet languages that add features on top of CSS and transpile to CSS), in the
past I’ve often used Sass.  When I first started learning about CSS preprocessors, the two main choices were Sass and
Less.  The reason I decided to learn Sass instead of Less was due to its greater popularity and me trying to follow
industry trends.  At the time, Bootstrap had just released version 4, which switched its stylesheet language from Less
to Sass<sup>1</sup>.  It didn't make sense for me to learn the preprocessor language that was being left in the dust.
</p>
<p>
Over time, I increasingly wished to learn the difference between Sass and Less.  It was hard for me to tell if there
were differences in the functionality of Sass or Less, or if Sass was picked as the favorite due to syntactical
preferences and third-party library support.  Last year I wrote two front-end application prototypes,
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/graphql-react-prototype">graphql-react-prototype</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype">apollo-client-server-prototype</a>.  Instead of
using a stylesheet technology I already knew such as Sass or JSS, I decided to learn Less and use it as the stylesheet
language for these prototypes.
</p>
<p>
Although I hoped to find interesting differences between the functionality of Less and Sass, in reality I found that
both languages were very similar.  While I’m sure engineers who work with both technologies extensively can find subtle
differences between the two, from a high level they provide the same capabilities on top of CSS.  Similar to Sass, Less
has variables, mixins, conditionals, and loops.  The main difference between the two is the syntax.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, Sass seems to have clearly superior syntax.  For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code>
 <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for">loops in Sass</a> have better syntax than
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">for</code> <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for">
loops in Less</a>, with Sass having a built-in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@for</code> rule and Less
requiring you to use a mixin<sup>2,3</sup>.  In other cases, syntactical preferences are more subjective.  For example,
a variable with the name <code className="jarombek-inline-code">myVariable</code> is written as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">$myVariable</code> in Sass and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@myVariable</code>
in Less.  Neither is superior, it just comes down to personal taste.
</p>
<p>
So why did Sass gain more traction in the software engineering world than Less?  Since both languages have similar
functionality, to some extent I believe it is because most engineers prefer the syntax of Sass<sup>4</sup>.  I also
think third-party Sass libraries and frameworks, such as <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, swayed
engineers who enjoyed their out-of-the-box functionality.  In my opinion, Sass does have slightly cleaner syntax, so
I am more inclined to use it instead of Less in my projects.

Currently, my favorite approach for authoring stylesheets is JSS, a CSS is JavaScript library.  You can read about it
in my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-29-2021-jss">JSS article</a> and

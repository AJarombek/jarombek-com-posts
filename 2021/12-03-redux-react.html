Redux is a state management pattern that is commonly used in complex React applications.  Redux, based on the Flux
design pattern, is helpful when application state is shared between many pages of a website and is updated
frequently<sup>1</sup>.  In my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a> website, Redux stores and uses
application state across all my webpages.  SaintsXCTF is a good example of a website that can benefit from
Redux;  it needs login information, user preferences, team memberships, group memberships, and more to be shared
amongst all pages.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I start by going over the basics of Redux.  I'll also explain the “ducks pattern”, which is an
approach to writing Redux code.  Then, I'll walk through the Redux configuration and code in my SaintsXCTF
application.  All the code for my SaintsXCTF web application is available in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web">GitHub</a> repository.

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library based on the Flux design pattern.
</p>
<Definition word="Flux">
<p>
Flux is a web-development design pattern and architecture which is an alternative to the MVC (Model View Controller)
pattern<sup>2,3</sup>.  Flex maintains application state in one or many <strong>stores</strong>.  Stores are updated
with <strong>actions</strong>, which contain new state data and instructions for updating a store<sup>4</sup>.  Actions
are passed to stores via a <strong>dispatcher</strong>.  Once actions reach the store, application state is updated
accordingly, and any views that use the application state are re-rendered.
</p>
<p>
Flux creates a unidirectional flow of data, beginning with an event on the UI, such as a button click. UI events
trigger actions, with travel through the dispatcher to a store. Finally, the UI updates according to the new state in
the store.  If you want to understand Flux in more detail, I recommend reading the official <a href="https://
facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview">In-Depth Overview</a>.
</p>
</Definition>
<Definition word="Redux">
<p>
Redux is based on the Flux design pattern with a few key differences.  Unlike Flux, Redux consists of a single store
containing an immutable state object.  Redux also does not have dispatchers.  Instead, Redux has
<strong>reducers</strong>.  Reducers are functions which take an action and the existing state as arguments.  During
the execution of a reducer function, a new state object is created and returned<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Similar to Flux, Redux follows a unidirectional data flow.  Once again, actions are created when UI events occur.
Actions pass data to the store, the state in the store is updated with the help of a reducer, and the UI is updated
accordingly.
</p>
</Definition>
<p>
Let's describe the main components of Redux in more detail.  These components include <strong>actions</strong>,
<strong>action creators</strong>, <strong>reducers</strong>, and <strong>the store</strong>.

<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Actions
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Actions are JavaScript objects which describe how to update the application state in the Redux store.  Action objects
have a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> field, which is a string that identifies the action.  Actions
often have additional fields with instructions on how to update the state or data to add to the state.  For example,
an action to sign in a user and place their username in the application state may look like
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{type: "SIGN_IN", username: "andy"}</code>.
</p>
<p>
Actions are dispatched to the Redux store.  The Redux store invokes a reducer function corresponding to the
action.  This reducer function returns a new application state with changes made, which are determined by the action.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Action Creators
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Action creators are functions that create Redux action objects.  They simplify the creation of actions by encapsulating
the logic for building an action of a specific type within a single function.  For example, the action
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{type: "SIGN_IN", username: "andy"}</code> can be built from an action creator
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">signIn()</code> that takes a username as an argument.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, action creators perform more complex logic, such as performing asynchronous operations to external services
and interfaces; for example, an action creator may invoke an API and create actions based on the response.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Reducers
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Reducers are functions that create new state objects.  Reducers take two arguments: an action object and an existing
state object.  Reducers create a copy of the existing state object and apply changes specified in the action.
The return value of a reducer is a new state object, which replaces the existing state object in the Redux store.
</p>
</div>
</ComparisonTableEntry>
<ComparisonTableEntry>
<h5 className="jarombek-cte-title">
Store
</h5>
<div className="jarombek-cte-body">
<p>
Redux applications contain a single store, which holds the application state.  Application state is immutable, i.e. an application
state object cannot be modified.  To change the state in the store, a new state object replaces an existing
state object.  New state objects are created with the help of reducer functions.  Reducer functions are called when
actions are dispatched to the store.

When using Redux in a React application, the <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start">React Redux</a>
library is often used to simplify the configuration and usage of Redux.  I utilize React Redux in my SaintsXCTF
application.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Ducks Pattern">Ducks Pattern</SectionTitle>
<p>
The <strong>ducks pattern</strong> relates to the file layout of Redux code.  In older applications, Redux code is
 often grouped into separate directories for actions, reducers, and action creators<sup>6</sup>.  With the ducks
pattern, actions, reducers, and action creators exist in the same files.  However, code is logically grouped in
separate files.
</p>
<p>
For example, my SaintsXCTF application has a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/master/src/
redux/modules">modules</a> directory containing all the Redux TypeScript files following the ducks
pattern.  Each file in this directory relates to a specific feature of the application.  The <a href="https://
github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/groups.ts">groups.ts</a> file, for example, contains
actions, reducers, and action creators that relate to group pages on the website (user's in SaintsXCTF can be members
of one or many groups).
</p>
<p>
The following code snippet is an abbreviated version of <strong>groups.ts</strong>:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
// groups.ts

// Actions
const GET_GROUP_REQUEST = 'saints-xctf-web/groups/GET_GROUP_REQUEST';
...

// Action Types
interface GetGroupRequestAction {
  type: typeof GET_GROUP_REQUEST;
  groupId: number;
}

...

// Reducers
function getGroupRequestReducer(state: GroupState, action: GetGroupRequestAction): GroupState {
  const existingGroupState = state.group[action.groupId] ?? {};

  return {
    ...state,
    group: {
      ...state.group,
      [action.groupId]: {
        ...existingGroupState,
        isFetching: true,
        lastUpdated: moment().unix(),
        serverError: null
      }
    }
  };
}

...

export default function reducer(state = initialState, action: GroupActionTypes): GroupState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case GET_GROUP_REQUEST:
      return getGroupRequestReducer(state, action);
    ...
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Action Creators
export function getGroupRequest(groupId: number): GetGroupRequestAction {
  return {
    type: GET_GROUP_REQUEST,
    groupId
  };
}

...
</CodeSnippet>
<SectionTitle title="Redux Application Setup">Redux Application Setup</SectionTitle>
<p>
Redux is configured within the React application using the <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start">
React Redux</a> library.  Both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">react-redux</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@types/react-redux</code> are specified as application dependencies in
the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a> file.  The
configuration of Redux begins in the entrypoint of the React application, <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/index.tsx#L35-L48">index.ts</a>.  A simplified version of the code is shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import configureStore from './redux/store';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

const store = configureStore();

const RoutedApp = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    &lt;Provider store={store}>
        &lt;App />
    &lt;/Provider>
  );
};

render(&lt;RoutedApp />, document.getElementById('react-container'));

export default RoutedApp;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
I removed all the details unrelated to Redux from this code, with the complete version available on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/index.tsx">GitHub</a>.  The React Redux library
supplies a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;Provider /></code> component, which makes the Redux store
available to all components in the application<sup>7</sup>.  As you will see later on, the Redux store is accessible
via React hooks.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;Provider /></code> is used at the top level of the application, right after
bootstrapping React onto the DOM with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">render()</code> method call.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">&lt;Provider /></code> takes a required prop
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">store</code>, which is the Redux store for the application.  In my case, the
Redux store is created with the line <code className="jarombek-inline-code">const store = configureStore()</code>.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">configureStore()</code> is a custom function, which is shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, Store } from 'redux';
import { routerMiddleware } from 'connected-react-router';
import { createLogger } from 'redux-logger';
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';
import reducer from './modules/reducers';

export const history = createBrowserHistory();

export default function configureStore(): Store {
  const loggerMiddleware = createLogger();
  const middleware = [routerMiddleware(history), loggerMiddleware, thunkMiddleware];

  const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(...middleware)(createStore);
  const store = createStoreWithMiddleware(reducer(history));

  return store;
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The code above is a simplified version of a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
master/src/redux/store.ts">store.ts</a> file in my application.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
configureStore()</code> is a function that returns a Redux store of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
Store</code>.  You will often see variants of the code above in Redux tutorials.  Let's walk through this code line
by line.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">const loggerMiddleware = createLogger()</code> creates a logging middleware for
Redux using the <strong>redux-logger</strong> library.  Redux middleware is a means for adding third party extensions
to Redux.  Third party libraries are invoked after actions are dispatched to the store, but before the store
invokes a reducer function<sup>8</sup>.  <strong>redux-logger</strong> provides middleware for logging actions to the
console output of a web browser.  This is very helpful for debugging.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">loggerMiddleware</code> is utilized in the line
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">const middleware = [routerMiddleware(history), loggerMiddleware, thunkMiddleware]
</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">middleware</code> is a list of Redux middlewares used in my
application.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">routerMiddleware</code> is a React Router middleware and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">thunkMiddleware</code> is a middleware for writing asynchronous code that
interacts with the Redux store (for example, dispatching an action based on the result of an API request)<sup>9</sup>.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(...middleware)(createStore)</code>
is a complicated looking piece of code.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">applyMiddleware</code> is a higher
order function (a function that returns another function).  It takes my list of Redux middlewares as an argument.
The result of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">applyMiddleware</code> is a function that takes
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createStore</code> as an argument.  The result is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createStoreWithMiddleware</code>, which itself is a function.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createStoreWithMiddleware()</code> is used to create a Redux store with our list
of middlewares applied.  The line <code className="jarombek-inline-code">createStoreWithMiddleware(reducer(history))</code>
accomplishes this task.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">reducer()</code> is a function that creates all the
Redux reducers for my application.  It also takes a browser history object as an argument
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">history</code>) for use with the React Router middleware.
</p>
<p>
The following code shows the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">reducer()</code> function (named here as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createRootReducer</code>).  It exists in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/reducers.ts">reducers.ts</a> file in my repository.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import { combineReducers, Reducer } from 'redux';
import { connectRouter } from 'connected-react-router';

import auth from './auth';
import registration from './registration';
import logs from './logs';
import memberships from './memberships';
import notifications from './notifications';
import profile from './profile';
import rangeView from './rangeView';
import teams from './teams';
import groups from './groups';
import { History } from 'history';

const createRootReducer = (history: History): Reducer =>
  combineReducers({
    router: connectRouter(history),

    memberships,
    notifications,
    profile,
    rangeView,
    teams,
    groups
  });

export default createRootReducer;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createRootReducer()</code> is a function that creates a reducing function for
the Redux store<sup>10</sup>.  In other words, it creates the Redux reducer for my application.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">createRootReducer()</code> returns the result of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">combineReducers()</code>, which is a utility function built-in to Redux.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">combineReducers()</code> takes an object of reducer functions as an argument.
It merges these reducers and returns a single reducer function that can be used by the Redux store.  With the help of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">combineReducers()</code>, reducers can be split across multiple files, allowing
engineers to follow the Ducks pattern.  As you can see, I have separate reducer functions for different application
features (<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/auth.ts#L506-L551">auth</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/registration.ts#L218-L243">registration</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/logs.ts#L660-L709">logs</a>, etc.).
Each of these files is referred to as a Redux Ducks module<sup>11</sup>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Redux Ducks Modules">Redux Ducks Modules</SectionTitle>
<p>
Each Redux Ducks module is a JavaScript or TypeScript file containing Redux actions, action creators, and a reducer.
When using TypeScript, a module can also contain type definitions for actions.
</p>
<p>
For example, in my React/TypeScript application, one of my Redux Ducks modules is <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/teams.ts">teams.ts</a>.
  <strong>teams.ts</strong> contains Redux logic for a single feature of my website - teams that users can be members
of.  My Redux Ducks modules are logically split into five sections: actions, action types, reducers, action creators,
and redux thunk functions.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Actions">Actions</SubTitle>
<p>
In Redux, actions have a type property, which is a unique identifier for the action.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> property is a string; all the type strings used in a module are
defined at the top of the module.  For example, these are the type strings defined in my <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/teams.ts#L15-L23">teams.ts</a> module.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
const GET_TEAM_REQUEST = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_REQUEST';
const GET_TEAM_SUCCESS = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_SUCCESS';
const GET_TEAM_FAILURE = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_FAILURE';
const GET_TEAM_GROUPS_REQUEST = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_GROUPS_REQUEST';
const GET_TEAM_GROUPS_SUCCESS = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_GROUPS_SUCCESS';
const GET_TEAM_GROUPS_FAILURE = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/GET_TEAM_GROUPS_FAILURE';
const SEARCH_TEAMS_REQUEST = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/SEARCH_TEAMS_REQUEST';
const SEARCH_TEAMS_SUCCESS = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/SEARCH_TEAMS_SUCCESS';
const SEARCH_TEAMS_FAILURE = 'saints-xctf-web/teams/SEARCH_TEAMS_FAILURE';
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
All actions follow the naming convention <code className="jarombek-inline-code">'application-name/module-name/ACTION_NAME'</code>.
While Redux does not mandate this convention, I find it elegant and effective in removing the risk of naming conflicts
between actions in different modules.
</p>
<p>
Action type strings are used by action creators and reducers.  Action creators use action type strings when
building an action object.  Reducers use action type strings to determine which reducer function to invoke based on
the action dispatched to the Redux store.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Action Types">Action Types</SubTitle>
<p>
Action types are used by TypeScript to ensure that action objects are well-typed.  In other words, an action type
defines an interface for an action, containing all the properties in an action and their corresponding types.  The
following code shows all the action types defined in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
master/src/redux/modules/teams.ts#L25-L87">teams.ts</a> module.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">

  | GetTeamGroupsRequestAction
  | GetTeamGroupsSuccessAction
  | GetTeamGroupsFailureAction
  | SearchTeamsRequestAction
  | SearchTeamsSuccessAction
  | SearchTeamsFailureAction;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Each action has a corresponding <code className="jarombek-inline-code">interface</code>, containing a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> property and zero to many additional properties.  For example, type
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">GetTeamSuccessAction</code> has a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type</code> property along with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">team</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">teamName</code> properties.  All these types are unioned together into a single
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">TeamActionTypes</code> type.
</p>
<p>
Action types are used extensively when defining reducers and action creators.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Reducers">Reducers</SubTitle>
<p>
In each module, there is a root reducer and one or many reducer functions.  The root reducer decides which reducer
function to invoke based on the type of an action dispatched to the Redux store.  The following code shows the root
reducer for my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/
teams.ts#L244-L267">teams.ts</a> module.

<p>
The root reducer is written as the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">reducer()</code> function.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">reducer()</code> is the main export of the Redux Ducks module.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">reducer()</code> takes two arguments: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
state</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">action</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
state</code> holds the existing state of the Redux store, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
action</code> holds an action object that was dispatched to the store.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
type</code> property of the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">action</code> object determines which reducer
function to invoke from the root reducer.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">action.type</code> is used in the switch statement to select a reducer function.
For example, if an action <code className="jarombek-inline-code">{type: "GET_TEAM_REQUEST", teamName: "saintsxctf"}</code>
is dispatched to the Redux store and the reducer is invoked, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getTeamRequestReducer(state, action)</code> will be called.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
getTeamRequestReducer()</code> has the following implementation:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
function getTeamRequestReducer(state: TeamState, action: GetTeamRequestAction): TeamState {
  const existingTeamState = state.team[action.teamName] ?? {};

action is dispatched may look like:
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
{
  team: {
    saintsxctf: {
      isFetching: true,
      lastUpdated: 1638565750,
      serverError: null
    }
  },
  search: {}
}

Every action type has a corresponding action creator, which is a function that creates an action object.  The following
code shows some of the action creators available in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
master/src/redux/modules/teams.ts#L269-L337">teams.ts</a> module.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
export function getTeamRequest(teamName: string): GetTeamRequestAction {
  return {
    type: GET_TEAM_REQUEST,
    teamName
  };
}

export function getTeamSuccess(team: Team, teamName: string): GetTeamSuccessAction {
  return {
    type: GET_TEAM_SUCCESS,
    team,
    teamName
  };
}

export function getTeamFailure(serverError: string, teamName: string): GetTeamFailureAction {
  return {
    type: GET_TEAM_FAILURE,
    serverError,
    teamName
  };
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Basically, action creators parameterize actions.  Return values of action creators are often dispatched directly to the
Redux store.  Other times, they are dispatched as part of Redux Thunk functions.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Redux Thunk Functions">Redux Thunk Functions</SubTitle>
<p>
Redux Thunk functions are created using the <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">redux-thunk</a> library.  Redux thunk
functions are action creators, except they return a function instead of an action<sup>12</sup>.  These functions
 run asynchronous code and dispatch actions to the Redux store depending on certain conditions.  The main use of
<strong>redux-thunk</strong> in my application is to make API calls and dispatch actions depending on API
responses.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following Redux Thunk function makes a call to my API, retrieving a team with a specific name.  It
exists in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/redux/modules/teams.ts#L339-L357">
teams.ts</a> module.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
export function getTeam(teamName: string): AppThunk&lt;Promise&lt;void>, TeamState> {
  return async function (dispatch: Dispatch): Promise&lt;void> {
    dispatch(getTeamRequest(teamName));

    try {
      const response = await api.get(`teams/${teamName}`);
      const { team } = response.data;

      dispatch(getTeamSuccess(team, teamName));
    } catch (error) {
      const { response } = error as AxiosError;
      const serverError = response?.data?.error ?? 'An unexpected error occurred.';

      if (response?.status !== 403) {
        dispatch(getTeamFailure(serverError, teamName));
      }
    }
  };
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">getTeam()</code> is a Redux Thunk function that returns an
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">async</code> function.  This function takes a single argument called
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch</code>, which is a Redux function that dispatches actions to the
store.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch</code> is used three times.  The first,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch(getTeamRequest(teamName))</code>, dispatches an action indicating that
 an API request is about to be made.  This is useful for implementing loading icons or loading screens.  Inside the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">try… catch</code> block, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
await api.get(`teams/${teamName}`)</code> makes the actual API call.  The second dispatch,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch(getTeamSuccess(team, teamName))</code>, dispatches an action when the
API call is successful.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">team</code> variable comes from the API response
body.  The third dispatch, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch(getTeamFailure(serverError, teamName))</code>
dispatches an action when the API call returns an error.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the Redux Thunk functions in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/
src/redux/modules/teams.ts#L339-L397">teams.ts</a> module or throughout my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/tree/master/src/redux/modules">entire application</a>, you will notice that most follow this same
pattern.

<SectionTitle title="React Redux State Management Code">React Redux State Management Code</SectionTitle>
<p>
When working with Redux in a React application, the <strong>react-redux</strong> library provides React hooks for
dispatching actions to the Redux store and reading application state from the Redux store.  These React hooks are
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">useDispatch()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
useSelector()</code>, respectively.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the example of teams in my application, let's look at the page which displays all the teams that a
user is a member of.
</p>
<InlineImage filename="12-3-21-teams-page.png" paddingTop="true" paddingBottom="true">
</InlineImage>
<p>
The following code is for a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">TeamsBody</code> component, which represents the
page shown above.  The code below is shortened for readability, with the full code available in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/master/src/components/teams/TeamsBody/TeamsBody.tsx">
TeamsBody.tsx</a> file in my repository.

<p>
First, notice that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">useDispatch()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">useSelector()</code> are imported from <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
react-redux</code>.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">useDistpatch()</code> is invoked to get a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch</code> function, with the line <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
const dispatch = useDispatch()</code>.  On the next two lines, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">useSelector</code>
is used to retrieve data from the Redux store; specifically, user profiles and teams are retrieved, saved in
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">userProfiles</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">teams</code>
variables, respectively.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">dispatch</code> is invoked within <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
useEffect()</code> React hooks.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">useEffect()</code> is beyond the scope of this
article; however, in general terms, this setup dispatches the results of action creators and Redux Thunk functions to
the Redux store when the webpage loads or React props/state change.  These Redux Thunk functions make the API calls
that supply data for the front-end application.  For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
dispatch(getUserMemberships(user.username))</code> gets all the team memberships from the API for the signed in user.
</p>
<p>
The return statement is the JSX for the React  component, which is translated into HTML when displayed on a web browser.

<p>
Redux is a great way to store complex front-end application state.  It integrates seamlessly with React and TypeScript.
While I don't recommend its use for basic applications, any time a website requires shared state across pages or persisted
sign in data, I recommend giving Redux a try.  All the front-end code for my SaintsXCTF application, which uses Redux,
 is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">GitHub</a>.

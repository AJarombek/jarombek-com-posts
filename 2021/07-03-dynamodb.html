DynamoDB is a NoSQL database on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a> specializing in key-value
and document storage.  DynamoDB is fully managed by AWS, meaning users don’t need to provision any servers for it
to run on.  I often compare DynamoDB to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=MongoDB&page=1">MongoDB</a>, due to
their similar functionality and JSON document/item structure.

Recently, DynamoDB has come up quite a bit in engineering conversations I’ve had in relation to building cloud native
applications.  I wrote <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">a</a>

<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-27-2017-mongodb-pt4">articles</a> on MongoDB in 2017 while I was prototyping
with the database.  Recently I did the same with DynamoDB, creating a sample DynamoDB table with
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Terraform&page=1">Terraform</a> and using AWS SDKs to modify and test its
contents.  This article discusses what I’ve learned about DynamoDB and showcases my prototype code.

DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database that is hosted on AWS. DynamoDB is closed source and fully managed by AWS; No
installation of DynamoDB on a server is required.  Engineers simply use the service, and are charged based on the
amount of data they store, along with read and write capacity<sup>1</sup>.  DynamoDB is both a key-value store and a
document database.  The main components of DynamoDB are tables, items, and attributes<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Table">
A DynamoDB table is a collection of items.  Tables define a schema for their items, however you don’t need to define
all the attributes that exist in items within the schema.  This makes DynamoDB tables very flexible compared to SQL
database tables, which have static schemas.  A DynamoDB table is roughly equivalent to a
<strong>MongoDB collection</strong>.

<Definition word="DynamoDB Item">
A DynamoDB item is an object with attributes.  Items are members of a table, and follow the schema of the table.  Items
are stored in a “marshalled” JSON format<sup>3,4</sup>. For example, the JSON data
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": "Andy"}</code> is stored in DynamoDB as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": {"S": "Andy"}}</code>. This is slightly different from MongoDB, which
stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.  A DynamoDB item is roughly equivalent to a <strong>MongoDB document</strong>.

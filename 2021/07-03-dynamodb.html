DynamoDB is a NoSQL database on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a> specializing in key-value
and document storage.  DynamoDB is fully managed by AWS, meaning users don’t need to provision any servers for it
to run on.  I often compare DynamoDB to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=MongoDB&page=1">MongoDB</a>, due to
their similar functionality and JSON document/item structure.
</p>
<p>
Recently, DynamoDB has come up quite a bit in engineering conversations I’ve had in relation to building cloud native
applications.  I wrote <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">a</a>

<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-27-2017-mongodb-pt4">articles</a> on MongoDB in 2017 while I was prototyping
with the database.  Recently I did the same with DynamoDB, creating a sample DynamoDB table with
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Terraform&page=1">Terraform</a> and using AWS SDKs to modify and test its
contents.  This article discusses what I’ve learned about DynamoDB and showcases my prototype code.

<SectionTitle title="What is DynamoDB?">What is DynamoDB?</SectionTitle>
<p>
DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database that is hosted on AWS. DynamoDB is closed source and fully managed by AWS; No
installation of DynamoDB on a server is required.  Engineers simply use the service, and are charged based on the
amount of data they store, along with read and write capacity<sup>1</sup>.  DynamoDB is both a key-value store and a
document database.  The main components of DynamoDB are tables, items, and attributes<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Table">
A DynamoDB table is a collection of items.  Tables define a schema for their items, however you don’t need to define
all the attributes that exist in items within the schema.  This makes DynamoDB tables very flexible compared to SQL
database tables, which have static schemas.  A DynamoDB table is roughly equivalent to a
<strong>MongoDB collection</strong>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Item">
A DynamoDB item is an object with attributes.  Items are members of a table, and follow the schema of the table.  Items
are stored in a “marshalled” JSON format<sup>3,4</sup>. For example, the JSON data
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": "Andy"}</code> is stored in DynamoDB as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": {"S": "Andy"}}</code>. This is slightly different from MongoDB, which
stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.  A DynamoDB item is roughly equivalent to a <strong>MongoDB document</strong>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Attribute">
A DynamoDB attribute is a name-value pair that exists on an item.  Attributes are the most fundamental building block
of data in DynamoDB.  The names of attributes are strings.  Attributes can have three types of values: scalar, document,
and set<sup>5</sup>. Scalar types include primitive data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. Document types
are JSON documents, containing objects and arrays. Set types are groups of scalar values.  A DynamoDB scalar is roughly
equivalent to a <strong>MongoDB field</strong>.
</Definition>
<p>
DynamoDB tables are required to have a primary key, and can optionally have one or more secondary indexes.  There are
two types of primary keys: partition keys and sort keys.  Partition keys and sort keys are assigned to attributes in a
table.  If a table only has a partition key, each item in the table must have a unique value for that partition key
attribute.  If a table has a partition key and a sort key, this is called a composite key.  In a composite key, the
combination of the partition key attribute and sort key attribute must be unique for each item in the table.  Partition
keys and sort keys also help DynamoDB with its internal storage of table data<sup>6</sup>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to primary keys, DynamoDB tables can be given secondary indexes. One thing that is different between
DynamoDB and a traditional SQL relational database is that queries of tables can only be performed on attributes that
are primary keys or secondary indexes in DynamoDB. In contrast, relational database tables can be queried using any of
their columns, no matter if they are a primary key, indexed or otherwise. This makes secondary indexes in DynamoDB
very important.
</p>
<p>
Secondary indexes allow for attributes other than the primary keys to be queried.  There are two types of secondary
indexes: <strong>global secondary indexes</strong> and <strong>local secondary indexes</strong>.  A global secondary
index creates an index with a partition key and sort key other than the ones assigned to the table, while a local
secondary index creates an index with a partition key matching the one assigned to the table, but with a different
sort key<sup>7</sup>.  While global secondary indexes are extremely useful, they are not free.  To build a secondary
index, DynamoDB must maintain an additional read-only projection of the table, which adds to service costs<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
My first impression of DynamoDB is that it's a very easy to use database, especially for those with MongoDB
experience.  I still have yet to see how well it scales up for large datasets, but for prototyping and small
applications it seems like a really nice option.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="DynamoDB Prototype Architecture">DynamoDB Prototype Architecture</SectionTitle>
<p>
The DynamoDB prototype I created consists of a single table with a primary key and a global secondary index.  The table
represents stuffed animals, and is appropriately named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code>.
The basic table architecture is configured with Terraform, along with a few items.  The following
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/infra/main.tf">Terraform code</a>
creates the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code> table.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "table" {
  name = "stuffed-animals"
  billing_mode = "PROVISIONED"
  read_capacity = 20
  write_capacity = 20

  hash_key = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "N"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "name"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "species"
    type = "S"
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name = "NameIndex"
    hash_key = "name"
    range_key = "species"
    write_capacity = 10
    read_capacity = 10
    projection_type = "INCLUDE"
    non_key_attributes = ["description"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "stuffed-animals-table"
    Application = "dynamodb-sample"
    Environment = "sandbox"
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_dynamodb_table</code> resource, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">hash_key</code> (partition key) argument sets the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">id</code> attribute as the partition key for the table. The table schema defines
three attributes in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">attribute</code> code blocks:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">id</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">N</code> (number),
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">S</code> (string), and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">species</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">S</code> (string).
As mentioned earlier, items can have more attributes than those defined in the schema, but schemas do give a rough
outline for the shape of items. The table also has one global secondary index named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">NameIndex</code>, which is defined in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">global_secondary_index</code> code block.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">NameIndex</code> has a hash key (partition key) of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> and a range key (sort key) of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">species</code>.
</p>
<p>
After creating the DynamoDB table, the Terraform code creates two items with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_dynamodb_table_item</code> resource.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "dotty" {
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.table.name
  hash_key = aws_dynamodb_table.table.hash_key
  item = file("dotty.json")
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "lily" {
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.table.name
  hash_key = aws_dynamodb_table.table.hash_key
  item = file("lily.json")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While this code is important for adding the items to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code>
table, the most interesting details are in the JSON files which are values for the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">item</code> attributes. For example, here is the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/infra/dotty.json">JSON file</a> for
the first item, a stuffed animal horse named Dotty.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "id": {"N": "1"},
  "name": {"S": "Dotty"},
  "species": {"S": "Horse"},
  "description": {"S": "Small spotted horse who loves to cuddle.  She also has beautiful flappy ears."},
  "favorite_activity": {"S": "Sleeping under a blanket"}
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the JSON is in the marshalled format discussed earlier, with data types specified for each attribute.  When
this Terraform code is built, the table and items are created and viewable from the AWS console.

The remainder of the DynamoDB prototype consists of AWS Go SDK coding for querying and creating items, and AWS Python
SDK coding for DynamoDB table and infrastructure tests.

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a> specializing in key-value
and document storage.  DynamoDB is fully managed by AWS, meaning users don't need to provision any servers for it
to run on.  I often compare DynamoDB to <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=MongoDB&page=1">MongoDB</a>, due to
their similar functionality and JSON document/item structure.
</p>
<p>
Recently, DynamoDB has come up quite a bit in engineering conversations I've had in relation to building cloud native
applications.  I wrote <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-15-2017-mongodb-pt1">a</a>
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-16-2017-mongodb-pt2">series</a>

 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/dec-27-2017-mongodb-pt4">articles</a> on MongoDB in 2017 while I was prototyping
with the database.  Recently I did the same with DynamoDB, creating a sample DynamoDB table with
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Terraform&page=1">Terraform</a> and using AWS SDKs to modify and test its
contents.  This article discusses what I've learned about DynamoDB and showcases my prototype code.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is DynamoDB?">What is DynamoDB?</SectionTitle>
<p>
DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database that is hosted on AWS. DynamoDB is closed source and fully managed by AWS; No
installation of DynamoDB on a server is required.  Engineers simply use the service and are charged based on the
amount of data they store, along with read and write capacity<sup>1</sup>.  DynamoDB is both a key-value store and a
document database.  The main components of DynamoDB are tables, items, and attributes<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Table">
A DynamoDB table is a collection of items.  Tables define a schema for their items.  However, you don't need to define
all the attributes that exist in an item within the schema.  This makes DynamoDB tables very flexible compared to SQL
database tables, which have static schemas.  A DynamoDB table is roughly equivalent to a
<strong>MongoDB collection</strong>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Item">
A DynamoDB item is an object with attributes.  Items are members of a table, and follow the schema of the table.  Items
are stored in a “marshalled” JSON format<sup>3,4</sup>. For example, the JSON data
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": "Andy"}</code> is stored in DynamoDB as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">{"name": {"S": "Andy"}}</code>. This is slightly different from MongoDB, which
stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.  A DynamoDB item is roughly equivalent to a <strong>MongoDB document</strong>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="DynamoDB Attribute">
A DynamoDB attribute is a name-value pair that exists on an item.  Attributes are the most fundamental building block
of data in DynamoDB.  The names of attributes are strings.  Attributes can have three types of values: scalar, document,
and set<sup>5</sup>. Scalar types include primitive data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. Document types
are JSON documents, containing objects and arrays. Set types are groups of scalar values.  A DynamoDB scalar is roughly
equivalent to a <strong>MongoDB field</strong>.
</Definition>
<p>
DynamoDB tables are required to have a primary key, and can optionally have one or more secondary indexes.  There are
two types of primary keys: <strong>partition keys</strong> and <strong>sort keys</strong>.  Partition keys and sort keys are assigned to attributes in a
table.  If a table only has a partition key, each item in the table must have a unique value for that partition key
attribute.  If a table has a partition key and a sort key, this is called a composite key.  In a composite key, the
combination of the partition key attribute and sort key attribute must be unique for each item in the table.  Partition
keys and sort keys also help DynamoDB with its internal storage of table data<sup>6</sup>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to primary keys, DynamoDB tables can have secondary indexes. One difference between
DynamoDB and traditional SQL relational databases is that in DynamoDB, queries of tables can only be performed on attributes that
are primary keys or secondary indexes. In contrast, relational database tables can be queried using any of
their columns, no matter if they are a primary key, indexed or otherwise. This makes secondary indexes in DynamoDB
very important.
</p>
<p>
Secondary indexes allow for attributes other than the primary keys to be queried.  There are two types of secondary
indexes: <strong>global secondary indexes</strong> and <strong>local secondary indexes</strong>.  A global secondary
index creates an index with a partition key and sort key other than the ones assigned to the table, while a local
secondary index creates an index with a partition key matching the one assigned to the table, but with a different
sort key<sup>7</sup>.  While global secondary indexes are extremely useful, they are not free.  To build a secondary
index, DynamoDB must maintain an additional read-only projection of the table, which adds to service costs<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
My first impression of DynamoDB is that it's very easy to use, especially for those with MongoDB
experience.  I have yet to see how well it scales up for large datasets, but for prototyping and small
applications it seems like a really nice option.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="DynamoDB Prototype Architecture">DynamoDB Prototype Architecture</SectionTitle>
<p>
The DynamoDB prototype I created consists of a single table with a primary key and a global secondary index.  The table
represents stuffed animals, and is appropriately named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code>.
The basic table architecture is configured with Terraform, along with a few items.  The following
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/infra/main.tf">Terraform code</a>
creates the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code> table.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "table" {
  name = "stuffed-animals"
  billing_mode = "PROVISIONED"
  read_capacity = 20
  write_capacity = 20

  hash_key = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "N"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "name"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "species"
    type = "S"
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name = "NameIndex"
    hash_key = "name"
    range_key = "species"
    write_capacity = 10
    read_capacity = 10
    projection_type = "INCLUDE"
    non_key_attributes = ["description"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "stuffed-animals-table"
    Application = "dynamodb-sample"
    Environment = "sandbox"
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_dynamodb_table</code> resource, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">hash_key</code> (partition key) argument sets the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">id</code> attribute as the partition key for the table. The table schema defines
three attributes inside <code className="jarombek-inline-code">attribute</code> code blocks:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">id</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">N</code> (number),
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">S</code> (string), and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">species</code> of type <code className="jarombek-inline-code">S</code> (string).
As mentioned earlier, items can have more attributes than those defined in the schema, but schemas do give a rough
outline for the shape of items. The table also has one global secondary index named
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">NameIndex</code>, which is defined in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">global_secondary_index</code> code block.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">NameIndex</code> has a hash key (partition key) of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> and a range key (sort key) of
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">species</code>.
</p>
<p>
After creating the DynamoDB table, the Terraform code creates two items with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_dynamodb_table_item</code> resource.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "dotty" {
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.table.name
  hash_key = aws_dynamodb_table.table.hash_key
  item = file("dotty.json")
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "lily" {
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.table.name
  hash_key = aws_dynamodb_table.table.hash_key
  item = file("lily.json")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While this code is important for adding the items to the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">stuffed-animals</code>
table, the most interesting details are in the JSON files which are values for the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">item</code> attributes. For example, here is the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/infra/dotty.json">JSON file</a> for
the first item, a stuffed animal horse named Dotty.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "id": {"N": "1"},
  "name": {"S": "Dotty"},
  "species": {"S": "Horse"},
  "description": {"S": "Small spotted horse who loves to cuddle.  She also has beautiful flappy ears."},
  "favorite_activity": {"S": "Sleeping under a blanket"}
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Notice that the JSON is in the marshalled format discussed earlier, with data types specified for each attribute.  When
this Terraform code is built, the table and items are created and viewable from the AWS console.

<p>
The remainder of the DynamoDB prototype consists of AWS Go SDK code for querying and creating items, and AWS Python
SDK code for DynamoDB table and infrastructure tests.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="DynamoDB Coding with the Go AWS SDK">DynamoDB Coding with the Go AWS SDK</SectionTitle>
<p>
AWS provides software development kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages, including Go and Python.  Recently I
started working with Go, a programming language developed at Google and first released in 2009.  I've really enjoyed
working with Go, and have tried to incorporate it into more and more projects.  In one sentence, the main reason I like
Go is that it has all the benefits of a statically typed language, but still has a concise syntax that is easy to write.
</p>
<p>
I decided to incorporate Go into my DynamoDB prototype through the use of the Go AWS SDK.  Using this SDK, I scan all
items, add items, remove items, and more from the DynamoDB table.  My Go code is located in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/app/main.go">main.go</a> file.
The AWS SDK has <a href="https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/">documentation</a> online, although
I've found it a bit incomplete.
</p>
<p>
The Go code is just a script in a single <code className="jarombek-inline-code">main()</code> function.  For starters,
it scans the DynamoDB table and checks that the expected number of items are returned.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())

if err != nil {
    panic("unable to load AWS SDK config, " + err.Error())
}

client := dynamodb.NewFromConfig(cfg)

tableName := "stuffed-animals"
input := &dynamodb.ScanInput{
    TableName: &tableName,
}

records, err := client.Scan(context.TODO(), input)

if err != nil {
    panic("Table scan failed, " + err.Error())
}

if records.Count != 2 {
    panic("Dotty and Lily were not found in DynamoDB!  They must be busy napping.")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
DynamoDB has two main API methods for getting items: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Scan</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Query</code>.  While a table scan retrieves all the items in a table, a
query uses primary keys and secondary indexes to retrieve a subset of items.  The next piece of code updates an
existing item in the table.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
teddy := map[string]types.AttributeValue{
    "id": &types.AttributeValueMemberN{Value: "3"},
    "name": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Teddy"},
    "species": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Bear"},
    "description": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{
        Value: "The OG and forever loyal, Teddy always gives and asks for nothing in return.",
    },
}

putInput := &dynamodb.PutItemInput{
    TableName: &tableName,
    Item: teddy,
}

_, err = client.PutItem(context.TODO(), putInput)

if err != nil {
    panic("Failed to create a new item in DynamoDB.")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The next piece of code bulk inserts three new items into the table.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
fluffy := map[string]types.AttributeValue{
    "id": &types.AttributeValueMemberN{Value: "4"},
    "name": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Fluffy"},
    "species": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Goat"},
    "description": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{
        Value: "Retired daredevil, Fluffy now enjoys relaxing under a warm blanket.",
    },
}

spiky := map[string]types.AttributeValue{
    "id": &types.AttributeValueMemberN{Value: "5"},
    "name": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Spiky"},
    "species": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Goat"},
    "description": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{
        Value: "Little brother of Fluffy.",
    },
}

grandmasBlanket := map[string]types.AttributeValue{
    "id": &types.AttributeValueMemberN{Value: "6"},
    "name": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Grandma's Blanket"},
    "species": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{Value: "Blanket"},
    "description": &types.AttributeValueMemberS{
        Value: "Does Grandma's blanket qualify as a stuffed animal?  The debate rages on.",
    },
}

fluffyPutRequest := types.PutRequest{
    Item: fluffy,
}

spikyPutRequest := types.PutRequest{
    Item: spiky,
}

grandmasBlanketPutRequest := types.PutRequest{
    Item: grandmasBlanket,
}

writeRequest := map[string][]types.WriteRequest{
    tableName: {
        { PutRequest: &fluffyPutRequest },
        { PutRequest: &spikyPutRequest },
        { PutRequest: &grandmasBlanketPutRequest },
    },
}

batchWriteInput := &dynamodb.BatchWriteItemInput{
    RequestItems: writeRequest,
}

_, err = client.BatchWriteItem(context.TODO(), batchWriteInput)

if err != nil {
    panic("Failed to create new items in DynamoDB (bulk insert).")
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The final piece of code deletes one of the items I added.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Go">
deleteKeyMap := map[string]types.AttributeValue{
    "id": &types.AttributeValueMemberN{Value: "6"},
}

deleteInput := &dynamodb.DeleteItemInput{
    TableName: &tableName,
    Key: deleteKeyMap,
}

_, err = client.DeleteItem(context.TODO(), deleteInput)
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
If there is one thing you should take away from this code, its that while DynamoDB operations are easy to work with,
they aren't as simplistic as SQL.  The expressiveness of SQL is often an argument used for relational SQL databases
over NoSQL databases, and that argument can be used against DynamoDB as well.  However, the setup ease of DynamoDB is
often such a great benefit that the lack of a sophisticated SQL-like querying model is a sacrifice worth taking.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="DynamoDB Testing with the Python AWS SDK">DynamoDB Testing with the Python AWS SDK</SectionTitle>
<p>
I wrote tests for my DynamoDB table in Python using the AWS SDK.  This
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/test/testTerraformInfra.py">test</a>
 <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/blob/master/samples/dynamodb/test/testGoSdkInfra.py">code</a>
provides more examples of how to scan and query a DynamoDB table.
</p>
<p>
As previously shown in the Go code, scanning a DynamoDB table is the simplest way to get all its items.  In Python,
scanning a table and checking its item count is achieved with the following code.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
table: Table = self.dynamodb_resource.Table('stuffed-animals')
response = table.scan()
items: List[dict] = response.get('Items')

self.assertEqual(2, len(items))
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
While I prefer the SQL equivalent of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename</code>,
scanning is very simple and easy.  Querying tables for items that match certain criteria is where things get a bit more
complicated.  For example, let's compare two queries.  The first query uses the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">id</code> partition key on the table to retrieve an item with an id of
<strong>2</strong>.  The second query uses the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">name</code> partition key on the
secondary index to retrieve an item with the name <strong>dotty</strong>
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
table: Table = self.dynamodb_resource.Table('stuffed-animals')
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('id').eq(2)
)
items: List[dict] = response.get('Items')

self.assertEqual(1, len(items))
</CodeSnippet>
<CodeSnippet language="Python">
response = table.query(
    IndexName='NameIndex',
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('name').eq('Dotty')
)
items: List[dict] = response.get('Items')

self.assertEqual(1, len(items))
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The syntax is pretty simple and can be easily learned through use, but the important takeaway is that queries are
written differently depending on whether you use a key on a table vs. a key on a secondary index. This is different from
SQL which treats all attributes (columns) the same when querying.  In SQL, when querying with a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">WHERE</code> clause there is no difference between filtering on a primary key
column vs. a foreign key column vs. an indexed column.
</p>
<p>
Advanced DynamoDB queries are beyond the scope of this article, but I plan to experiment with them in the future.
However, just based off these simple queries I can tell that the querying mechanism is not as robust as SQL.

The final piece of my DynamoDB prototype is a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Jenkins&page=1">Jenkins</a> job that
 runs the full process of building the Terraform infrastructure, testing the state of the DynamoDB table, running the Go
code, and then testing the table again. The code for this Jenkins job is available on

<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
DynamoDB is a valuable NoSQL database for engineers who work with AWS to know, given how easy it is to set up and its
ability to hold JSON structured data.  The query mechanism DynamoDB offers is inferior to SQL, but this is often an
acceptable sacrifice for applications to take.  Compared to MongoDB, DynamoDB is easier to setup and manage, but
MongoDB has more querying and data aggregation features that make it more suited for complex applications.  As I work
with DynamoDB more, I'll better understand how it scales and know more of its pros and cons.  All the code for the
DynamoDB prototype is available on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/tree/master/samples/dynamodb">GitHub</a>.

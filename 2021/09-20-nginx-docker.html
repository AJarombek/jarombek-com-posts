Many of my applications contain front-end components and API components.  These two components are loosely coupled but
communicate with each other over HTTPS.  For example, my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a>
application has a React front-end which communicates with a Flask REST API back-end, along with other API Gateway REST
APIs.  One way to accomplish this communication from front-end to API is by explicitly writing the URLs of the APIs
in the front-end code.  This works fine, but it also exposes information about the API origin servers to clients.
Origin server information exposure can be avoided by passing all API traffic through the same URL as the front-end
application. This is accomplished using a reverse proxy.

<p>
The following image shows my SaintsXCTF website, and how the URL of the API is hidden from clients.  If users inspect
the website’s network traffic, they see HTTPS requests sent to the reverse proxy server for <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>,
instead of the actual API server <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>.

This article discusses reverse proxy servers, walks through examples from my applications, and provides application
source code; allowing you to achieve similar results.  More specifically, it looks at creating Nginx reverse proxies
in Docker containers.

<p>
When discussing Nginx reverse proxies, there are two distinct technologies to unpack: Nginx and reverse proxies.
</p>
<Definition word="Nginx">
Nginx (pronounced Engine-X) is an open source web server which can be used as a reverse proxy<sup>1</sup>.  It is
commonly used for serving content from HTTP requests, as well as caching and load balancing requests.  Nginx is
comparable in popularity with Apache HTTP Server, which is another open source web server.  Nginx has its own
configuration language, which engineers use to adjust the web server’s behavior<sup>2</sup>.
</Definition>
<Definition word="Reverse Proxy">
A reverse proxy server sits in between a client and one or many back-end servers.  The reverse proxy server takes
in requests from the client, and distributes those requests to the servers sitting behind it appropriately.  When the
reverse proxy server sends responses from it’s back-end servers to the client, it does so without alluding to the
existence of the back-end servers at all.  From the client’s perspective, responses originate from the reverse proxy
server itself.  Reverse proxy servers are used to hide back-end servers, cache responses, load balance, and more<sup>3</sup>.
</Definition>
<p>
Using Nginx’s configuration language, servers can be configured as reverse proxy servers.  While these servers can exist
on physical machines or virtual machines, the Nginx servers discussed in this article exist on Docker containers.

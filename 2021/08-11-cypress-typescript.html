Cypress is an end to end (e2e) testing framework written in JavaScript for front-end applications.  Cypress tests run
in a Chrome web browser or a headless browser, navigating through and interacting with web pages.  It's
reasonable to compare Cypress to other test automation frameworks such as Selenium or Puppeteer; however, unlike those frameworks, Cypress was created
specifically for writing end to end tests.  Because of its test first design, Cypress provides lots of features that
make writing end to end tests easy.  It is currently my preferred end to end testing tool.
</p>
<p>
While Cypress tests can be written in JavaScript, as is the case with my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
jarombek-com/tree/v2.0.4/cypress/integration">jarombek.com</a> application, Cypress also has TypeScript support.  Nowadays,
I write most of my front-end applications in TypeScript due to its type safety.  In my experience, TypeScript helps
reduce the number of bugs and type mismatch mistakes in JavaScript code.  For applications written in TypeScript, it is
great to be able to write Cypress tests in TypeScript as well.  This helps keep the programming language uniform
across the front-end application code and test code.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I discuss the basics of Cypress and how I use it to test my front-end applications.  All the Cypress
 code I show is written in TypeScript.  The Cypress test code comes from two of my application repositories:
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype/tree/master/client/cypress">apollo-client-server-prototype</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/v2.0.4/cypress">saints-xctf-web</a>.

<SectionTitle title="What is End to End Testing">What is End to End Testing?</SectionTitle>
<Definition word="End to End Testing">
End to end (E2E) testing is the practice of writing tests for an application from one end to another, from beginning to
end.  In essence, these tests cover the entire execution flow of an application in a production-like environment.  In
the case of a front-end application, this means testing the application by interacting with the UI as an actual user
would. Because these tests are executed in a production-like environment, all the API calls used by the front-end code
are invoked as part of the tests.  This results in the application being executed from end to end - from the front-end
to the back-end and database.
</Definition>
<p>
With Cypress, end to end tests are run in a web browser.  Tests navigate to a web page and make assertions about the
content shown.  Then, they can interact with the page and make further assertions about what changed in the UI, check
what network calls were made, and more.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Cypress Basics">Cypress Basics</SectionTitle>
<p>
Cypress is installed using its <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress">cypress</a> npm package.  Cypress is
pretty easy to configure within an application.  For example, my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com">saintsxctf.com</a>
application uses Cypress and is configured to use it with TypeScript.  For starters, its repository
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">saints-xctf-web</a> is written as an npm package, with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cypress</code> defined as a dev dependency in its <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/package.json#L77">package.json</a> file.  Next, a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress.json">cypress.json</a> file exists in the root directory of the npm
package.  This is the main configuration file for Cypress, with the contents of my configuration file shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8090",
  "ignoreTestFiles": ["*.md"],
  "env": {
    ...
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Although the fields of the configuration file are optional, they do help simplify tests and configure the settings of
Cypress to fit your needs<sup>1</sup>.  In my configuration file, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">baseUrl</code>
configures the default base URL to use for all my tests, so that I don't need to copy-paste it across all my test cases.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">ignoreTestFiles</code> configures the Cypress test runner to ignore any Markdown
files in the test directory, in my case which are used for documentation purposes.  Finally,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">env</code> sets environment variables which are accessible to the Cypress test
code.  Cypress has many additional <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Options">
configuration options</a> listed in their documentation.
</p>
<p>
The actual Cypress test code is written in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/v2.0.4/cypress">cypress</a>
directory located in the root of the npm package.  The <strong>cypress</strong> folder and its subdirectories are
created as a scaffold automatically when Cypress first runs in the project, so there is no need to create these
manually.  Inside <strong>cypress</strong> are four subdirectories - <strong>fixtures</strong>, <strong>integration</strong>,
<strong>plugins</strong>, and <strong>support</strong> - along with a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/tsconfig.json">tsconfig.json</a> file to configure TypeScript.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-cypress-directory.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The <strong>integration</strong> directory holds the Cypress end to end tests.  In my case, these tests are TypeScript
files with <strong>.e2e.test.ts</strong> file extensions.  For example, the Cypress tests for the home page of my
<a href="https://saintsxctf.com">saintsxctf.com</a> website are located in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/integration/Home.e2e.test.ts">Home.e2e.test.ts</a> file.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>fixtures</strong> directory contains static assets used by the tests.  The majority of the files in my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/fixtures">fixtures</a> directory are JSON
files representing mocked API responses.  In certain end to end tests, it's preferable to use fixed API responses
instead of ones from an actual live API.  This is often due to the unpredictability of API data, and a need to test
specific repeatable scenarios.  It's also due to the requirement of testing failure scenarios on the website, such as
when an API returns an unexpected error code.  These scenarios are easily achieved by mocking the API responses with
the JSON files found in the <strong>fixtures</strong> directory.  The other static assets found in my
<strong>fixtures</strong> directory are pictures, which are used for testing profile picture and group picture
uploading on my website.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>plugins</strong> directory contains a single <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
v2.0.4/cypress/plugins/index.js">index.js</a> JavaScript file that runs in Node.js before the Cypress tests
begin<sup>2</sup>.  This file is used to configure first-party and third-party tooling which extends the functionality
of Cypress.  For example, my plugins file configures a <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/
code-coverage#E2E-code-coverage">code coverage plugin</a> to generate code coverage reports for my end to end
tests<sup>3</sup>.  Code coverage reports require an additional <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@cypress/code-coverage</code>
dev dependency in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/package.json#L51">package.json</a>
file.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>support</strong> directory contains custom commands used throughout Cypress tests.  Custom
commands contain reusable code, making the Cypress tests more concise and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jun-17-2019-terraform-module#dry-principal">DRY</a>.  The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
v2.0.4/cypress/support/index.ts">index.ts</a> file in the <strong>support</strong> directory is run automatically before
 every Cypress test file, so that the custom commands don't need to be manually imported into all the test
 files<sup>4</sup>.  There is a whole section of this article dedicated to writing custom commands in Cypress.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/tsconfig.json">tsconfig.json</a> file in
the <strong>cypress</strong> folder creates and configures a TypeScript project for the Cypress tests, separate from the
TypeScript project for the source code.  The most important property of the JSON configuration is
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">compilerOptions.types</code>, specifying that only type definitions
specific to Cypress should be used in the test code<sup>5</sup>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JSON">
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "baseUrl": "../node_modules",
    "target": "ES5",
    "lib": ["ES5", "DOM"],
    "types": ["cypress", "cypress-file-upload"]
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
There are two main ways to run Cypress tests: in a web browser and in a headless browser.  Inside my <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/package.json#L120-L122">package.json</a> file, I specify multiple custom commands
for running Cypress tests.  The first command, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cypress open</code> (aliased as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy:open</code>), opens the Cypress test runner and allows test files
 to be run in a web browser.  The test runner is shown below.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-cypress-test-runner.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The test runner lists all the end to end test files, referred to as <strong>specs</strong>, which exist in the
<strong>integration</strong> directory.  Clicking any of the file names opens a web browser and begins running
the tests.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-cypress-browser.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
In the screenshot above, all three tests passed.  While the tests run, the Cypress commands that execute are displayed
on the left hand side of the browser.  On the right hand side, the current state of the website in the test is shown.
This is great for seeing tests execute on the UI, and allows for easy debugging if tests are failing.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-cypress-executed-test.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The other way to run tests is with a headless browser.  Headless browsers provide an execution environment similar to a
web browser, except they run from a command line<sup>6</sup>.  Executing Cypress tests in headless browsers is great
for CI/CD pipelines which run tests in an automated fashion.  The
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cypress run --headless</code> command (aliased as
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy:headless</code>) runs all the Cypress tests in a headless browser.
</p>
<p>
In the remainder of this article, I walk you through Cypress test cases and reusable Cypress functions.  All these
examples are used in the end to end tests for my <a href="https://saintsxctf.com">saintsxctf.com</a> website.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Cypress Test Examples">Cypress Test Examples</SectionTitle>
<p>
Let's start with some basic examples which test the SaintsXCTF home page.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-home-page.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Cypress test code is built on top of the <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha testing framework</a> and the
<a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai assertion library</a>.  Therefore, engineers familiar with these libraries will
recognize the coding syntax right away.  Cypress test specs often have a similar layout to the following specification
for my website's home page.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
describe('Home E2E Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/');
  });

  it('loads the home page as expected', () => {
    cy.get('.sxctf-home').contains('Cross Country and Track & Field Team Exercise Logs').should('exist');
  });

  ...
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The home page's end to end test spec is located in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/
cypress/integration/Home.e2e.test.ts">Home.e2e.test.ts</a> file.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">describe()</code>
function gives a name to the test suite with its first argument and defines all the test cases along with pre-test and
post-test hook methods with its second argument.  In my example, the test suite is named "Home E2E Tests".
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">beforeEach()</code> is a pre-test hook which executes before every test case.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">beforeEach()</code> executes one built-in Cypress command,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.visit('/');</code>, which navigates the browser to the home page of my
website before each test.
</p>
<p>
The final piece of code in the snippet above is an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">it()</code> function, which 
defines a test case.  The test is given the name "loads the home page as expected" and executes a few Cypress commands.  
Most Cypress tests utilize function chaining, and this basic example is no different.  First, the call to 
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.get('.sxctf-home')</code> gets any HTML elements with the class 
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">sxctf-home</code>.  The result could be zero, one, or many HTML elements.  Next, 
the result of this function is chained with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
.contains('Cross Country and Track & Field Team Exercise Logs')</code>.  The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
contains()</code> function narrows down the HTML elements retrieved with the  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
cy.get()</code> call to only those elements that contain the text "Cross Country and Track & Field Team Exercise Logs".  
Finally, the result of this function is chained with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.should('exist')</code>.  
This ensures that at least one HTML element exists with a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">sxctf-home</code> class 
and the text "Cross Country and Track & Field Team Exercise Logs".  If no elements match these two requirements, the
Cypress test fails.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-home-title-test.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Let's look at a few more basic tests used on my application's home page.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
it("'about' header button navigates down to the 'about' section", () => {
  cy.get('.aboutButton').click();
  cy.url().should('include', '/#about');
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This test takes an action, clicking on an HTML element with an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aboutButton</code>
class.  The test then asserts that the URL of the webpage has changed to <strong>/#about</strong>, signaling that the
user was navigated down the page to the "About" section.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-home-about-test.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The website under test is mobile-responsive, and I have a separate file for mobile end to end tests called
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/integration/Home.mobile.e2e.test.ts">
Home.mobile.e2e.test.ts</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
describe('Home Mobile E2E Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.viewport(400, 800);
    cy.visit('/');
  });

  it("'About' navbar dropdown link navigates down to the 'About' section", () => {
    cy.url().should('equal', `${Cypress.config('baseUrl')}/`);
    cy.get('.sxctf-nav-hamburger').click();
    cy.get('.aj-nav-list-item').contains('About').click();
    cy.url().should('equal', `${Cypress.config('baseUrl')}/#about`);
  });

  ...
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The mobile home page test suite has a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">beforeEach()</code> hook function similar
to the one in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/integration/Home.e2e.test.ts">
Home.e2e.test.ts</a>, except this time it also changes the viewport to a mobile phone screen size.  This is achieved
with the Cypress command <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.viewport(400, 800)</code> which changes the viewport
width to 400px and the viewport height to 800px.
</p>
<p>
The test shown in this code snippet is logically equivalent to the "About" section test discussed prior.  This time, a
mobile dropdown is clicked to navigate to the "About" section instead of a button in the website header.
</p>

<SectionTitle title="Advanced Cypress Test Examples">Advanced Cypress Test Examples</SectionTitle>
<p>
Now let's look at some of the advanced Cypress tests written in my end to end test suite.  Don't worry too much about
the tiny code details; instead, focus on the big picture of what Cypress is capable of.
</p>
<SubTitle title="Create New Exercise Log">Create New Exercise Log</SubTitle>
<p>
Let's look at a test that creates a new exercise log.  This test exists in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/integration/NewLog.e2e.test.ts#L69-L109">NewLog.e2e.test.ts</a> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
it('able to create a new running exercise log', () => {
  cy.route('POST', '/api/v2/logs/').as('createLog');

  const formattedDate = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD');
  const finalFormattedDate = moment().format('MMM. Do, YYYY');

  cy.visit('/log/new');
  cy.get('.sxctf-image-input input[name="name"]').type('Test Run');
  cy.get('.sxctf-image-input input[name="location"]').type('New York, NY');
  cy.get('.sxctf-image-input input[name="date"]').type(formattedDate);
  cy.get('.sxctf-image-input input[name="distance"]').type('5');
  cy.get('.sxctf-image-input input[name="time"]').type('3625');
  cy.get('textarea').type('Running Log Generated from E2E Tests');
  cy.get('button').contains('Create').click();

  cy.wait('@createLog');

  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('exist');
  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('contain.text', 'Exercise log created!');

  // The success message should disappear after 4 seconds.
  cy.wait(4000);
  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('not.exist');

  cy.get('.dashboardButton').click();
  cy.url().should('equal', `${Cypress.config('baseUrl')}/dashboard`);

  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').should('have.length', 10);
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).findDataCy('exerciseLogUser').should('contain.text', 'Andy Jarombek');
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).findDataCy('exerciseLogTitle').should('contain.text', 'Test Run');

  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).findDataCy('exerciseLogLocation').should('contain.text', 'New York, NY');
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).findDataCy('exerciseLogDistance').should('contain.text', '5 miles');
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).findDataCy('exerciseLogTimePace').should('contain.text', '36:25 (7:17/mi)');
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog').eq(0).should('have.class', 'average');
  cy.get('#logFeed .exerciseLog')
    .eq(0)
    .findDataCy('exerciseLogDescription')
    .should('contain.text', 'Running Log Generated from E2E Tests');
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The test starts by filling out an exercise log creation form with the help of the Cypress
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">type()</code> commands.  This code snippet also demonstrates how other JavaScript
libraries, such as the moment.js date/time library, can be used in Cypress tests.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-create-log-test.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.get('button').contains('Create').click()</code> clicks a button which makes
an API call to create a new exercise log.  The Cypress test waits for this API call to complete with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.wait('@createLog')</code> command.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
@createLog</code> is an alias for a HTTP route.  It is defined at the beginning of the test with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.route('POST', '/api/v2/logs/').as('createLog')</code> command.  After the
exercise log is created, the Cypress test navigates back to the dashboard page of the website and makes sure the new
exercise log appears.

<p>
The test navigates to the profile page of user <strong>andy</strong> and clicks on the <strong>Monthly Calendar</strong>
tab.  From there, the Cypress test asserts that the calendar shows the proper month and exercise mileage statistics.

saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/support/commands.d.ts#L37-L42">commands.d.ts</a>).  I discuss custom Cypress
commands in the next section of this article, but this code demonstrates how they can greatly simplify end to end tests.
</p>
<p>
For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.calendarWeekCheck()</code> checks the mileage for each day in a
week on the calendar.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.calendarWeekCheck(0, [null, 5.39, 5.83, 8.64, 5.96, 8.75, 9.12], 43.69)</code>
looks at the first week in the calendar, and asserts that the total mileage is <strong>43.69</strong>.  It iterates over
each day, checking that the first day displays no mileage, the second day displays <strong>5.39</strong> miles, the
third day displays <strong>5.83</strong> miles, etc.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-monthly-calendar-2.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
This custom Cypress command is called six times for each month.  Since the test changes the month displayed on the
calendar multiple times, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.calendarWeekCheck()</code> is invoked almost 20
times.  Placing the logic for testing a week of calendar data in a reusable Cypress command saved many lines of code!
</p>
<SubTitle title="API Error Scenario">API Error Scenario</SubTitle>
<p>
One final advanced Cypress test checks what happens to the website if an API request fails.  Specifically, it checks
the scenario where adding a user to a group in the website fails.  This test exists in a <a href="https://github.com/
AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/integration/GroupAdmin.mock.e2e.test.ts#L377-L421">GroupAdmin.mock.e2e.test.ts</a>
file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
it('shows an error if adding a pending user fails', () => {
  cy.andyAdminMemberships();

  const groupAlumniMembersRoute = cy.route({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '**/api/v2/groups/members/1',
    response: '@groupAlumniAdminPendingMembers'
  });

  groupAlumniMembersRoute.as('groupAlumniMembersRoute');

  cy.visit('/admin/group/1');

  cy.alumniGroupAdminMockAPICalls();

  const groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute = cy.route({
    method: 'PUT',
    url: '**/api/v2/groups/members/1/Tom',
    response: {
      self: '/v2/groups/members/1/Tom',
      updated: false,
      group_member: null,
      error: 'The group membership failed to update.'
    },
    status: 500
  });

  groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute.as('groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute');

  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('not.exist');
  cy.getDataCy('pendingMember').eq(0).find('.aj-contained-button').should('contain.text', 'Accept').click();
  cy.getDataCy('acceptDenyModal').find('.aj-contained-button').contains('ACCEPT MEMBERSHIP').click();

  cy.wait('@groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute');

  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('exist');
  cy.getDataCy('alert').should(
    'contain.text',
    'An unexpected error occurred while accepting a users membership request. ' +
      'Try reloading the page. If this error persists, contact andrew@jarombek.com.'
  );

  cy.getDataCy('alert').getDataCy('alertCloseIcon').click();
  cy.getDataCy('alert').should('not.exist');
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The main objective of this test is to prove that an error message is displayed to the user during an unexpected API
failure scenario.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-api-error.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The test starts by navigating to the webpage and mocking the API calls.  This test does not directly call the API, due
to its specific data requirements.  It also needs to simulate a failed API call.  The failed API call is defined in the
statement which creates the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute</code> variable.  The
function call to <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.route()</code> defines a custom API response and sets the
HTTP status code to <strong>500</strong>, which is an error code for an internal server error.  Whenever an HTTP PUT
request to a URL matching the pattern <strong>**/api/v2/groups/members/1/Tom</strong> is made, Cypress intercepts it and
returns the custom API response and status code.
</p>
<p>
The API route with the mocked response is given an alias <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute</code>.  When attempting to accept a user into a group, the test ensures that this mocked
API call is invoked with the command <code className="jarombek-inline-code">cy.wait('@groupMembersUpdateErrorRoute')</code>.
This command runs after the <strong>Accept Membership</strong> button is clicked.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/8-11-21-saintsxctf-api-error-2.png"/>

<p>
After the mocked API call is invoked, the test asserts that the webpage displays an alert message explaining the error.

<SectionTitle title="Custom Cypress Commands">Custom Cypress Commands</SectionTitle>
<p>
Cypress allows you to easily create custom commands or overwrite existing commands.  This helps make tests more readable
and promotes the creation of reusable test code.  I use custom Cypress commands extensively in my end to end tests.
Custom commands are found in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/v2.0.4/cypress/support">support</a>
subdirectory of my repositories <strong>cypress</strong> directory.
</p>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cypress.Commands.add()</code> creates a new Cypress command<sup>7</sup>.  The
following code creates a basic command named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">setUserInLocalStorage</code> which
puts a JSON string representing a user in the web browser's local storage.  It exists in my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/support/commands.ts#L16-L41">commands.ts</a>
file, which contains custom commands used throughout the end to end tests.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
Cypress.Commands.add('setUserInLocalStorage', () => {
  localStorage.setItem(
    'user',
    JSON.stringify({
      isFetching: false,
      didInvalidate: false,
      lastUpdated: 1596919187,
      activation_code: 'abc123',
      class_year: 2017,
      deleted: null,
      description: 'I sometimes like to run.',
      email: 'andrew@jarombek.com',
      favorite_event: 'Shakeout',
      first: 'Andy',
      last: 'Jarombek',
      last_signin: '2020-08-13 12:53:18',
      location: 'Riverside, CT',
      member_since: '2016-12-23',

      salt: null,
      subscribed: null,
      username: 'andy',
      week_start: 'monday'
    })
  );
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Cypress.Commands.add()</code> takes two arguments: the name of the custom
command and the function body of the custom command.  Since my Cypress code is written in TypeScript, it also needs a
type definition for the custom command.  A type definition prevents type errors when using custom commands, and also
serves as useful documentation.  Each of my TypeScript files containing custom commands has a corresponding <strong>*.d.ts</strong>
file, containing the type definitions.  For example, my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/
v2.0.4/cypress/support/commands.ts">commands.ts</a> file has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/support/commands.d.ts">commands.d.ts</a> file, with the following type definition
for my custom <code className="jarombek-inline-code">setUserInLocalStorage</code> command.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
declare namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
        /**
         * Custom command to put user details in the browser's localStorage.
         * @example setUserInLocalStorage()
         */
        setUserInLocalStorage(): void;

        ...
    }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code adds the custom command type to the global Cypress <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Chainable</code>
interface<sup>8</sup>, making it accessible in TypeScript Cypress tests.  In my end to end tests, the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">setUserInLocalStorage</code> command is commonly used in pre-test hook functions,
such as the following code snippet from <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/
integration/Dashboard.e2e.test.ts#L16">Dashboard.e2e.test.ts</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
describe('Dashboard E2E Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.setUserInLocalStorage();
    ...
  });

  ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Most of my custom Cypress commands encapsulate other Cypress commands that assert information about HTML elements.  In
a prior example, I showed a Cypress test which looked at a monthly calendar of exercise data.  One of the custom
Cypress commands used in that test, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">calendarWeekCheck()</code>, is shown below.
It exists in a <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/support/shared.ts#L115-L155">
shared.ts</a> file.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
Cypress.Commands.add(
  'calendarWeekCheck',
  (week: number, miles: (number | string | null)[], totalMiles: number | string) => {
    cy.getDataCy('week')
      .eq(week)
      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(0)
      .should(miles[0] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[0] ? `${miles[0]}Miles` : 'Miles');
    cy.getDataCy('week')
      .eq(week)
      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(1)
      .should(miles[1] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[1] ? `${miles[1]}Miles` : 'Miles');
    cy.getDataCy('week')

      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(2)
      .should(miles[2] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[2] ? `${miles[2]}Miles` : 'Miles');

      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(3)

      .eq(4)
      .should(miles[4] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[4] ? `${miles[4]}Miles` : 'Miles');
    cy.getDataCy('week')
      .eq(week)
      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(5)
      .should(miles[5] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[5] ? `${miles[5]}Miles` : 'Miles');
    cy.getDataCy('week')
      .eq(week)
      .findDataCy('day')
      .eq(6)
      .should(miles[6] ? 'contain.text' : 'not.contain.text', miles[6] ? `${miles[6]}Miles` : 'Miles');
    cy.getDataCy('week').eq(week).findDataCy('weekTotal').should('contain.text', `${totalMiles}Miles`);
  }
);
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This command goes through the seven days in the week and checks what text is displayed for each day in the calendar.
While most of the sub-commands in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">calendarWeekCheck()</code> command are
built-in Cypress commands, two are not: <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDataCy()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy()</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
Cypress.Commands.add('getDataCy', (value) => {
  return cy.get(`[data-cypress=${value}]`);
});

Cypress.Commands.add('findDataCy', { prevSubject: true }, (subject, value) => {
  return cy.wrap(subject).find(`[data-cypress=${value}]`);
});
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Both <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDataCy()</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy()</code>
retrieve HTML elements with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes">
data attributes</a> named <code className="jarombek-inline-code">data-cypress</code>.  The value of the data attribute
is passed to the Cypress commands through a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">value</code> parameter.  One thing
you may have noticed is that <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDataCy()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy()</code> have return values, while the prior two custom Cypress
commands did not.  As previously stated, Cypress commands are built to be chained together.  By returning the HTML
elements with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">data-cypress</code> data attributes, both these custom Cypress
commands can be chained with regular Cypress commands.  You can see this in the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
calendarWeekCheck()</code> command code.
</p>
<p>
The chainable properties of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">getDataCy()</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy()</code> are made clear by looking at their type definitions in
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/blob/v2.0.4/cypress/support/commands.d.ts#L37-L42">commands.d.ts</a>,
specifically their return types of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Chainable&lt;Element&gt;</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
/**
 * Chainable function for getting elements with a data-cypress attribute.
 * @param value The value of the data attribute on an HTML element.
 * @example getDataCy('button')
 */
getDataCy(value: string): Chainable&lt;Element&gt;;

/**
 * Child chainable function for finding elements with a data-cypress attribute.
 * @param value The value of the data attribute on an HTML element.
 * @example findDataCy('button')
 */
findDataCy(value: string): Chainable&lt;Element&gt;;
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Another thing you may have noticed is that the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy</code> command is
defined with an additional <code className="jarombek-inline-code">{ prevSubject: true }</code> value.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">prevSubject</code> configures a command to either be a parent command or a child
command<sup>9</sup>.  By default, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">prevSubject</code> is assigned the value
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>, which means it is a parent command that doesn't take a value from
a previous command.  In other words, a parent command always appears at the beginning of a Cypress command chain.
Unlike the previous commands I've shown which implicitly use the default value of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
prevSubject</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy</code> is explicitly configured to be a child
command.  This means it is always used in the middle or the end of a Cypress command chain.  Look closely at the
definition of <code className="jarombek-inline-code">findDataCy</code> and you will see it takes an additional
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">subject</code> argument, which is the result of a prior Cypress command.  In
this case, the prior result is a list of HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
As a final custom Cypress command example, I want to show that custom commands don't necessarily have to just use
built-in commands and other custom commands for their implementations.  The following
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">setTokenInLocalStorage</code> custom command makes an API call to my applications
authentication API, and then sets the authentication token response in the browsers local storage and in an environment
variable.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="TypeScript">
import axios from 'axios';
import * as moment from 'moment';

Cypress.Commands.add('setTokenInLocalStorage', () => {
  const existingToken = Cypress.env('authToken');
  const existingTokenExpiration = Cypress.env('authTokenExpiration');

  if (existingToken && moment(existingTokenExpiration) > moment()) {
    cy.log('Using existing token');
    cy.log(`Existing token expires ${existingTokenExpiration}`);
    localStorage.setItem('token', existingToken);
    return;
  }

  cy.log('Retrieving new auth token');

  const instance = axios.create({
    baseURL: Cypress.env('authUrl'),
    timeout: 5000
  });

  instance
    .post('/token', {
      clientId: 'andy',
      clientSecret: Cypress.env('SXCTF_PASSWORD')
    })
    .then((res) => {
      const token = res.data.result;
      Cypress.env('authToken', token);

      const tokenExpiration = moment().add('45', 'minutes').format();
      Cypress.env('authTokenExpiration', tokenExpiration);

      localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.info(error);
    });
});
</CodeSnippet>

Cypress is my go-to end to end testing library.  It works great with both JavaScript and TypeScript, and has an easy to
learn and extensible API.  The ability to run Cypress tests in a web browser and watch the tests interact with a web
page is a fantastic feature that makes testing easy, even for newcomers to the front-end engineering space.  All my
Cypress test code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype/tree/master/
client/cypress">apollo-client-server-prototype</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web/tree/

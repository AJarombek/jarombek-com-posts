In my relatively short time as a software engineer, I’ve used many different approaches to writing stylesheets for
web applications.  My initial naive approach was writing a single CSS stylesheet per application, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf/blob/master/views/style.css">styles.css</a> file for my SaintsXCTF
application that I wrote in college.  Although this was a common practice in the early days of web development, lumping
an entire website's styles into a single file has many downsides.  First, a single stylesheet is difficult to read and
gets very long.  Second, it doesn’t follow programming principles like
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-17-2019-terraform-module#dry-principal">DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-20-2018-intro-programming#abstraction">abstraction</a>, and encapsulation.
Third, CSS lacks many programming language features which enable scalable and reusable code, such as functions,
conditional statements, and variables.

<UpdateInfo date="June 29th, 2021">
While writing this article I learned that CSS recently added variables into its specification<sup>1</sup>.  Variable
support is a great new addition (although, unsurprisingly, it is not supported byInternet Explorer). If CSS continues
to improve, I may consider its use in certain future applications.

To help bring order to the chaos of CSS stylesheets, different CSS methodologies were introduced.  These ensured that
CSS code followed certain conventions, thus making it easier to read. One of the common CSS methodologies is BEM, which
sets naming conventions for HTML element classes, which are used in CSS code<sup>2</sup>.  I never used these
conventions since I believed there was a better alternative: <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass">Sass</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features such as mixins, conditionals, extensions, variables, and more. I’ve used
Sass in both prototype code and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com">production level code</a>. In fact,
Sass is the stylesheet language used for this website!
</p>
<p>
The Sass code for this website (which is written in React) is structured so that each component has its own stylesheet
file.  Reusable Sass code is achieved with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass#mixins">mixins</a>;
mixins are groups of styles that are “mixed in” with other styles. While Sass is nice to work with, it’s not without
its shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
For starters, there is no easy way to dynamically change styles based on application state.  You can’t pass JavaScript
variables containing values to Sass to determine which styles to show.  Also, even though Sass code can be split into
many files, it still creates styles in a global namespace, which can result in unexpected conflicts between
stylesheets.  One way to remedy this is to give each stylesheet a unique root level CSS selector and make all other
styles exist in child CSS selectors.
</p>
<p>
For example, in a UI component called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Note</code>, you can have a Sass
stylesheet <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com/blob/master/src/client/Note.scss">Note.scss</a> with a
root level <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note</code> CSS selector and two child CSS selectors:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-icon</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-body</code>.

<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
@import "./styles/mixins/elegantIcons";
@import "./styles/mixins/sylexiads";
@import "./styles/variables";

.jarbek-note {
  display: flex;
  background-color: lighten($color-warning, 10%);

  .jarbek-note-icon {
    @include elegantIcons;
    font-size: 32px;
    padding: 10px 30px 10px 10px;
    color: #555;
  }

  .jarbek-note-body {
    @include sylexiad;
  }
}

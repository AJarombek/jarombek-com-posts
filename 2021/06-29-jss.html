In my relatively short time as a software engineer, I've used many different approaches to writing stylesheets for
web applications.  My initial naive approach was writing a single CSS stylesheet per application, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf/blob/master/views/style.css">styles.css</a> file for my SaintsXCTF
application that I wrote in college.  Although this was a common practice in the early days of web development, lumping
an entire website's styles into a single file has many downsides.  First, a single stylesheet is difficult to read and
gets very long.  Second, it doesn't follow programming principles like
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-17-2019-terraform-module#dry-principal">DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-20-2018-intro-programming#abstraction">abstraction</a>, and encapsulation.
Third, CSS lacks many programming language features which enable scalable and reusable code, such as functions,
conditional statements, and variables.
</p>
<UpdateInfo date="June 29th, 2021">
While writing this article I learned that CSS recently added variables into its specification<sup>1</sup>.  Variable
support is a great new addition (although, unsurprisingly, it is not supported by Internet Explorer). If CSS continues
to improve, I may consider its use in certain future applications.
</UpdateInfo>
<p>
To help bring order to the chaos of CSS stylesheets, different CSS methodologies were introduced.  These ensured that
CSS code followed certain conventions, thus making it easier to read. One common CSS methodology is BEM, which
sets naming conventions for HTML element classes, which are used in CSS code<sup>2</sup>.  I never used these
conventions since I believed there was a better alternative: <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass">Sass</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features such as mixins, conditionals, extensions, variables, and more on top of CSS. I've used
Sass in both prototype code and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com">production level code</a>. In fact,
Sass is the stylesheet language used for this website!
</p>
<p>
The Sass code for this website (which is written in React) is structured so that each React component has its own stylesheet
file.  Reusable Sass code is achieved with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass#mixins">mixins</a>;
mixins are groups of styles that are “mixed in” with other styles. While Sass is nice to work with, it's not without
its shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
For starters, there is no easy way to dynamically change styles based on application state.  You can't pass JavaScript
variables containing values to Sass to determine which styles to show.  Also, even though Sass code can be split into
many files, it still creates styles in a global namespace, which can result in unexpected conflicts between
stylesheets.  One way to remedy this is to give each stylesheet a unique root level CSS selector and make all other
styles exist in child CSS selectors.
</p>
<p>
For example, in a UI component called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Note</code> with a
 <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com/blob/master/src/client/Note.scss">Note.scss</a> stylesheet, I defined a
root level <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note</code> CSS selector and two child CSS selectors:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-icon</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-body</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
@import "./styles/mixins/elegantIcons";
@import "./styles/mixins/sylexiads";
@import "./styles/variables";

.jarbek-note {
  display: flex;
  background-color: lighten($color-warning, 10%);

  .jarbek-note-icon {
    @include elegantIcons;
    font-size: 32px;
    padding: 10px 30px 10px 10px;
    color: #555;
  }

  .jarbek-note-body {
    @include sylexiad;
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These Sass shortcomings are remedied in JSS, my new favorite stylesheet approach for React applications.  Although JSS
isn't perfect, it has many great qualities which are worth discussing.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is JSS">What is JSS?</SectionTitle>
<p>
JSS, sometimes referred to as “CSS in JavaScript”, is a JavaScript library which allows stylesheets to be authored in
JavaScript code.  These stylesheets take advantage of the JavaScript language and its ability to create reusable
code.  JSS also creates unique class names from your stylesheet code, removing any worries of conflicting stylesheet
selectors<sup>3</sup>. As for all those fancy Sass features such as functions, conditional statements, and
variables - JSS uses JavaScript, which has all these features and more.  In my opinion, JavaScript has a far superior
syntax to Sass.
</p>
<p>
The greatest advantage of JSS is its ability to conditionally change styles depending on application state. Application
state for UI applications written in JavaScript is stored in variables, containing primitive or object data types.
I'll demonstrate this ability in this article, along with my
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-30-2021-react-jss">followup article</a> on React JSS.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Writing JSS Stylesheets">Writing JSS Stylesheets</SectionTitle>
<p>
JSS code is written with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jss">jss</a> npm module. JSS also supports plugins,
although I utilize the default plugins provided by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jss-preset-default">
jss-preset-default</a> npm module<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I created an npm project which uses JSS to style some basic HTML elements.  The code for this project, located on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss">GitHub</a>, consists of
an <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.html">
index.html</a> application entrypoint file, an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js">index.js</a> file
which adds additional elements and styles them with JSS, and a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/server.js">server.js</a>
file which starts a server with Express to host the webpage.
</p>
<p>
The JSS application displays a running exercise log, similar to those shown on my
<a href="https://saintsxctf.com">SaintsXCTF</a> website. When viewed in the browser, the UI looks like the following
screenshot:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The JSS code in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js">
index.js</a> will be our main focus going forward.  At the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js#L7-L10">
top of the file</a>, I install JSS and initialize it with the default plugin preset.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import jss from "jss";
import preset from "jss-preset-default";

jss.setup(preset());
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
Next, I <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js#L33-L99">
create all the JSS styles</a>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const styles = {
    '@global': {
        body: {
            backgroundColor: '#000',
            margin: 0
        }
    },
    page: {

        height: '100vh',
        minHeight: 500,
        backgroundColor: '#222',

        '& > p': {
            margin: 0,
            fontSize: 14,
            textAlign: 'right',
            ...robotoSlabMixin
        }
    },
    bodySection: {
        marginTop: 20
    },
    dataField: {
        margin: 0,
        fontSize: 14,
        ...robotoSlabMixin
    },
    description: {

    },
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
As you can see, JSS styles are simply a JavaScript object!  This object contains properties, most of which represent
class names.  For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">page</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">exerciseLog</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">headerSection</code>
are classes that are attached to HTML elements. While most styles created with JSS are written with classes, you can
also use CSS at-rules such as media queries (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@media</code>) and keyframes
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">@keyframes</code>)<sup>5,6</sup>. JSS also allows you to nest CSS selectors
within classes, enabling more fine-grained control.  JSS has some great examples of these approaches on their
<a href="https://cssinjs.org/jss-syntax?v=v10.6.0">website</a>.
</p>
<p>
As I previously mentioned, JSS creates unique class names for its stylesheets.  This means that those
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">page</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exerciseLog</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">headerSection</code> properties in the JavaScript object aren't the exact
class names when rendered in the browser. Instead, JSS creates custom names loosely based on the property names. This
behavior is proven by opening the developer tab of our web page and viewing the classes assigned to HTML elements.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-29-21-jss-class-names.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
As you can see, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">page</code> was replaced with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">page-0-0-1</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exerciseLog</code> was
replaced with <code className="jarombek-inline-code">exerciseLog-0-0-2</code>, and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">headerSection</code> was replaced with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">headerSection-0-0-1</code>.  This name mangling prevents naming conflicts when
writing multiple classes with the same name in a different JSS style objects.
</p>
<p>
One thing you may have noticed in the JSS styles was a property called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">@global</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
'@global': {
  body: {
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    margin: 0
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This property allows you to define styles in the global namespace as you would in traditional CSS code.  In other words,
it bypasses JSS' unique class naming, instead applying styles to all HTML elements that match certain CSS selectors.
</p>
<p>
Another thing demonstrated in my JSS code is how to utilize JavaScript language features to create reusable code.
For example, I use a separate object and the JavaScript spread operator to apply matching styles to multiple classes.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const robotoSlabMixin = {
    fontStyle: 'normal',
    fontWeight: 'normal',
    fontFamily: 'RobotoSlab-Regular, Helvetica, serif'
}

const styles = {
    ...
    titleLink: {
        color: 'rgb(51, 51, 51)',
        fontSize: 16,
        textDecoration: 'none',
        ...robotoSlabMixin
    },
    title: {
        fontSize: 16,
        margin: 0,
        textDecoration: 'underline',
        ...robotoSlabMixin
    },
    ...
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This code applies the styles in <code className="jarombek-inline-code">robotoSlabMixin</code> to both the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">titleLink</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">title</code> classes.
In another example, I create an array of hex color codes and a number corresponding to an index in the array.  Both the
array and index are used in the JSS style object to determine the background color of an element.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
const FeelColors = [
    '#EA9999',
    '#FFAD99',
    '#EAC199',
    '#FFD699',
    '#FFFFAD',
    '#E3E3E3',
    '#C7F599',
    '#99D699',
    '#99C199',
    '#A3A3FF'
];

const currentFeel = 6;

const styles = {
    ...
    exerciseLog: {
        backgroundColor: FeelColors[currentFeel],
        ...
    },
    ...
};
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-30-2021-react-jss">upcoming article</a> on React JSS, I will show how
 reusability and dynamic styling can be used in a production application.

<p>
In this article I discussed many positive qualities of the JSS library.  These include the use of JavaScript syntax,
style reusability, dynamic styling, and naming conflict resolution.  Despite these great qualities, JSS is not
perfect.  IDE support isn't great, meaning you won't get the same autocompletion as you would with CSS or Sass.  Styles
also need to be wrapped in quotes since they are string values assigned to properties.  This isn't quite as elegant as
CSS or Sass where values such as <code className="jarombek-inline-code">auto</code> or
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">flex</code> are built into the language itself.  Finally, you need to remember
to use camel case instead of dash case for styles.  For example, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">font-size</code>
in CSS and Sass is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">fontSize</code> in JSS.  Once you get accustomed to JSS that
last point isn't much of an issue.
</p>
<p>
Even with these downsides, JSS is a great library that I highly recommend for new frontend
applications, especially those written in React. In my
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-30-2021-react-jss">next article</a>, I will discuss React JSS, a library that
integrates JSS with React components. I will also showcase how it is used in my
<a href="https://saintsxctf.com">SaintsXCTF</a> application. All the code from this article is located on
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss">GitHub</a>.

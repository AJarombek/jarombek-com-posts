In my relatively short time as a software engineer, I’ve used many different approaches to writing stylesheets for
web applications.  My initial naive approach was writing a single CSS stylesheet per application, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf/blob/master/views/style.css">styles.css</a> file for my SaintsXCTF
application that I wrote in college.  Although this was a common practice in the early days of web development, lumping
an entire website's styles into a single file has many downsides.  First, a single stylesheet is difficult to read and
gets very long.  Second, it doesn’t follow programming principles like
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-17-2019-terraform-module#dry-principal">DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)</a>,
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-20-2018-intro-programming#abstraction">abstraction</a>, and encapsulation.
Third, CSS lacks many programming language features which enable scalable and reusable code, such as functions,
conditional statements, and variables.
</p>
<UpdateInfo date="June 29th, 2021">
While writing this article I learned that CSS recently added variables into its specification<sup>1</sup>.  Variable
support is a great new addition (although, unsurprisingly, it is not supported byInternet Explorer). If CSS continues
to improve, I may consider its use in certain future applications.
</UpdateInfo>
<p>
To help bring order to the chaos of CSS stylesheets, different CSS methodologies were introduced.  These ensured that
CSS code followed certain conventions, thus making it easier to read. One of the common CSS methodologies is BEM, which
sets naming conventions for HTML element classes, which are used in CSS code<sup>2</sup>.  I never used these
conventions since I believed there was a better alternative: <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass">Sass</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features such as mixins, conditionals, extensions, variables, and more. I’ve used
Sass in both prototype code and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com">production level code</a>. In fact,
Sass is the stylesheet language used for this website!
</p>
<p>
The Sass code for this website (which is written in React) is structured so that each component has its own stylesheet
file.  Reusable Sass code is achieved with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-10-2018-sass#mixins">mixins</a>;
mixins are groups of styles that are “mixed in” with other styles. While Sass is nice to work with, it’s not without
its shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
For starters, there is no easy way to dynamically change styles based on application state.  You can’t pass JavaScript
variables containing values to Sass to determine which styles to show.  Also, even though Sass code can be split into
many files, it still creates styles in a global namespace, which can result in unexpected conflicts between
stylesheets.  One way to remedy this is to give each stylesheet a unique root level CSS selector and make all other
styles exist in child CSS selectors.
</p>
<p>
For example, in a UI component called <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Note</code>, you can have a Sass
stylesheet <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com/blob/master/src/client/Note.scss">Note.scss</a> with a
root level <code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note</code> CSS selector and two child CSS selectors:
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-icon</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">.jarbek-note-body</code>.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="Sass">
@import "./styles/mixins/elegantIcons";
@import "./styles/mixins/sylexiads";
@import "./styles/variables";

.jarbek-note {
  display: flex;
  background-color: lighten($color-warning, 10%);

  .jarbek-note-icon {
    @include elegantIcons;
    font-size: 32px;
    padding: 10px 30px 10px 10px;
    color: #555;
  }

  .jarbek-note-body {
    @include sylexiad;
  }
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
These Sass shortcomings are remedied in JSS, my new favorite stylesheet approach for React applications.  Although JSS
isn’t perfect, it has many great qualities which are worth discussing.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="What is JSS">What is JSS?</SectionTitle>
<p>
JSS, sometimes referred to as “CSS in JavaScript”, is a JavaScript library which allows stylesheets to be authored in
JavaScript code.  These stylesheets can take advantage of the JavaScript language and its ability to create reusable
code.  JSS also creates unique class names from your stylesheet code, removing any worries of conflicting stylesheet
selectors<sup>3</sup>. As for all those fancy Sass features such as functions, conditional statements, and
variables - JSS uses JavaScript, which has all these features and more.  In my opinion, JavaScript has a far superior
syntax to Sass as well.
</p>
<p>
The greatest advantage of JSS is its ability to conditionally change styles depending on application state. Application
state for UI applications written in JavaScript is stored in variables, containing primitive or object data types.
I’ll demonstrate this ability in this article, along with my followup article on React JSS.

<SectionTitle title="Writing JSS Stylesheets">Writing JSS Stylesheets</SectionTitle>
<p>
JSS code is written with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jss">jss</a> npm module. JSS also supports plugins,
although I utilize the default plugins provided by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jss-preset-default">
jss-preset-default</a> npm module<sup>4</sup>.
</p>
<p>
I created an npm project which uses JSS to style some basic HTML elements.  The code for this project, located on
GitHub, consists of an <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.html">
index.html</a> application entrypoint file, an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js">index.js</a> file
which adds additional elements and styles them with JSS, and a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/server.js">server.js</a>
file which starts a server with Express to host the webpage.
</p>
<p>
The JSS application displays a running exercise log, similar to those shown on my
<a href="https://saintsxctf.com">SaintsXCTF</a> website. When viewed in the browser, the UI looks like the following
screenshot:

The JSS code in <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js">
index.js</a> will be our main focus going forward.  At the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-sources/blob/master/2021/06-Jun/06-29-jss/index.js#L7-L10">
top of the file</a>, I install JSS and initialize it with the default plugin preset.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="JavaScript">
import jss from "jss";
import preset from "jss-preset-default";

jss.setup(preset());

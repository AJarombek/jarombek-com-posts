<SectionTitle title="Initial Architecture">Infrastructure Overview</SectionTitle>
<p>
SaintsXCTF application infrastructure can be grouped into two categories - AWS and Kubernetes.  This article only
discusses the AWS infrastructure, which has a green background in the diagram below.  The Kubernetes infrastructure,
which has a red background in the diagram, is discussed in the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
oct-25-2021-saints-xctf-v2-k8s-infrastructure">next article</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-aws-architecture.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
In Terraform code, the SaintsXCTF AWS infrastructure is logically grouped into modules.  These modules include (but are
not limited to) a load balancer to the Kubernetes infrastructure, an application asset S3 bucket, a user asset S3
bucket, an authentication REST API, an AWS Lambda function REST API, and a MySQL RDS database.  The other Terraform
modules in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">SaintsXCTF infrastructure repository</a>
perform smaller tasks such as debugging, database backups, and configuring SSL/TLS certificates.  These are not
discussed in this article.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Development and Production Infrastructure">Development and Production Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
While designing the SaintsXCTF version 2.0 infrastructure, I put a major emphasis on creating separate production and
development environments.  Since the initial website version was live during development of version 2.0, I needed a
separate non-production configuration to use for testing.  Besides for the domain names and AWS resource names, the infrastructure
between the production and development environments is identical.  This allows for predictable behavior
when building the production environment once the development environment is fully tested.  I plan to continue using
the development environment for testing new infrastructure changes going forward.
</p>
<p>
Under normal circumstances, the development environment isn't running in order to save money.  However, recreating it
 only requires some <code className="jarombek-inline-code">terraform apply</code> commands invoked from
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/global-jenkins-jobs/tree/master/saints-xctf/infrastructure">Jenkins jobs</a>.
When the development environment is running, the web application, main API, authentication API, and function API are accessible from
<strong>dev.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>dev.api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>dev.auth.saintsxctf.com</strong>,
and <strong>dev.fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>.  Their respective production equivalents are accessible from
<strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>auth.saintsxctf.com</strong>, and
<strong>fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>.
</p>
<p>
As previously mentioned, the SaintsXCTF AWS Terraform infrastructure is logically grouped into modules.  All these
modules are directories at the top level of the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  Most
 modules are configured differently for development and production environments.  For example, the
authentication API module has the following directory structure.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-terraform-module.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
There are three environmental configurations in this module - one for resources shared across all environments
 (<strong>all</strong>), one for development (<strong>dev</strong>), and one for production (<strong>prod</strong>).
 These environmental configurations invoke the submodules, which in the case
of the authentication API are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">api-gateway</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">lambda</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">secrets-manager</code>.
For example, inside <strong>saints-xctf-com-auth/env/prod</strong> is a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-auth/env/prod/main.tf">main.tf</a>
file which provisions the production infrastructure through the submodules.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.15.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 3.42.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "andrew-jarombek-terraform-state"
    encrypt = true
    key = "saints-xctf-infrastructure/saints-xctf-com-auth/env/prod"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

module "lambda" {
  source = "../../modules/lambda"
  prod = true
}

module "api-gateway" {
  source = "../../modules/api-gateway"
  prod = true

  authenticate-lambda-name = module.lambda.authenticate-function-name
  authenticate-lambda-invoke-arn = module.lambda.authenticate-function-invoke-arn
  token-lambda-name = module.lambda.token-function-name
  token-lambda-invoke-arn = module.lambda.token-function-invoke-arn
}

module "secrets-manager" {
  source = "../../modules/secrets-manager"
  prod = true

  rotation-lambda-arn = module.lambda.rotate-function-arn

  secret_rotation_depends_on = [
    module.lambda.rotate-function-arn,
    module.lambda.rotate-secrets-manager-permission-id,
    module.lambda.rotate-log-group-id
  ]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The Terraform submodules are invoked with certain input variables, including a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">prod</code> flag.  This variable determines whether the infrastructure needs to
be built in the production environment (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>) or the development
environment (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>). Most of the modules I talk about in the upcoming
segments follow this environment/submodule pattern.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Load Balancer to EKS">Load Balancer to EKS</SectionTitle>
<p>
The Terraform module which creates an AWS Application Load Balancer to route traffic to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=aws%20eks&page=1">AWS EKS</a> is unique compared to the other modules
discussed in this article.  Instead of using the AWS Terraform provider to build the infrastructure, the load balancer
is created by the Kubernetes Terraform provider.  Specifically, the EKS cluster has an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-28-2020-eks#alb-ingress-controller-and-external-dns">ALB Ingress Controller</a>
(now known as an <a href="https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/">AWS Load Balancer
Controller</a>) running in a Kubernetes pod.  This ingress controller is capable of building load balancers that route traffic to
Kubernetes services. Using the Kubernetes Terraform provider, a Kubernetes <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ingress</code>
object is created with certain annotations, resulting in the ingress controller provisioning load balancer
infrastructure in AWS.
</p>
<p>
In the context of SaintsXCTF, both the web application and main API are hosted on Kubernetes.  The load balancer
created by the ingress controller routes traffic to Kubernetes for both the <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong> and
<strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong> domains.  The Terraform module for the load balancer and Kubernetes Ingress object
exists in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-ingress">
saints-xctf-com-ingress</a> directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">
saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  I will provide more details about this code in my
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-25-2021-saints-xctf-v2-k8s-infrastructure">upcoming article</a> on
SaintsXCTF Kubernetes infrastructure.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Application Asset S3 Bucket">Application Asset S3 Bucket</SectionTitle>
<p>
SaintsXCTF contains images and videos which are hosted in an S3 bucket behind a CloudFront distribution. I refer to
this bucket as the "application asset S3 bucket", and it is accessible from <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>.  I
wrote an <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-15-2020-s3-react">article</a> about hosting static websites on S3 and
CloudFront, and the concept is similar for <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>. S3 holds the images and videos as
objects, and the CloudFront CDN speeds up the retrieval of these assets.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-com-asset.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The Terraform module for the application asset S3 bucket exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-asset">
saints-xctf-com-asset</a> directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">
saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  In this module there is just one production environment configuration.
There is no separate development configuration since the assets are the same for both development and production
environments.  Also, during development, there is no harm in adding additional assets that aren't yet accessible on
the production website.
</p>
<p>
At a high level, the <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong> module contains a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-asset/main.tf">main.tf</a>
file with the following resources.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
#-----------------------
# Existing AWS Resources
#-----------------------

data "aws_acm_certificate" "wildcard-saintsxctf-com-cert" {
  domain = "*.saintsxctf.com"
}

data "aws_acm_certificate" "wildcard-asset-saintsxctf-com-cert" {
  domain = "*.asset.saintsxctf.com"
}

data "aws_route53_zone" "saintsxctf" {
  name = "saintsxctf.com."
}

#--------------------------------------
# New AWS Resources for S3 & CloudFront

resource "aws_route53_record" "asset-saintsxctf-a" {...}

resource "aws_route53_record" "www-asset-saintsxctf-a" {...}

#-------------------
# S3 Bucket Contents
#-------------------

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "saintsxctf-png" {...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
First, existing ACM certificates are retrieved so that HTTPS requests to <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong> are
secured by SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates are used in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_cloudfront_distribution</code> resources for building CloudFront
distributions.  Next, the existing <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong> Route53 zone is retrieved for use in creating DNS A
records for <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong> and <strong>www.asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Next comes the new AWS resources.  The S3 bucket containing SaintsXCTF assets is created with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_s3_bucket</code> resource. There are two CloudFront distributions created
for the S3 bucket - one for <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong> and another for
<strong>www.asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>. These are created with the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_cloudfront_distribution</code> resource. Each CloudFront distribution
also gets a Route53 A record, created by the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_route53_record</code>
resources. The final resources are the S3 bucket objects, which are images and videos. These are created with
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_s3_bucket_object</code> resources.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="User Asset S3 Bucket">User Asset S3 Bucket</SectionTitle>
<p>
Similarly to how the <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong> S3 bucket contains application assets for the SaintsXCTF
website, the <strong>uasset.saintsxctf.com</strong> S3 bucket contains user assets. These assets include profile
pictures and group pictures. The Terraform module for the user asset S3 bucket is nearly identical to the application
asset S3 bucket. One main difference is user assets (S3 objects) are not declared as resources in the Terraform code.
Instead, they are uploaded by users through the website. I will discuss this process in a future article when going
over the SaintsXCTF Lambda Function API.
</p>
<p>
The Terraform module for the application user asset S3 bucket exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-uasset">saints-xctf-com-uasset</a>
directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a>
repository.

<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-com-uasset.png"/>
</figure>
<SectionTitle title="Authentication REST API">Authentication REST API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The SaintsXCTF application has four AWS Lambda functions related to authentication, two of which are exposed through a
REST API by API Gateway.  The premise of the authentication API is to use
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/mar-11-2018-jwt">JWTs</a> to authenticate users of the application.  With a proper
 JWT, users can make API calls and operate within the website and mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
The Terraform module for the authentication API exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-auth">saints-xctf-com-auth</a>
directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a>
repository.  The authentication API also has a separate
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-auth">saints-xctf-auth</a> repository for the AWS Lambda function
source code.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-com-auth.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The infrastructure diagram above shows the four authentication-based AWS Lambda functions. They are
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthenticate</code>, <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFToken</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthorizer</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFRotate</code>.
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthenticate</code> and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFToken</code>
are exposed through the authentication API, while <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthorizer</code> and
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFRotate</code> are only for internal use.
</p>
<p>
All four AWS Lambda functions are written in Python.  Their general use is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Upon sign in, the <strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/token</strong> endpoint is invoked, which calls the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFToken</code> function. The user's credentials are passed with this
request and the response contains a JWT if the credentials are valid.
</li>
<li>
Every time an API call that requires authentication is made to <strong>https://api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, the
<strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/authenticate</strong> endpoint is invoked by the API.  This
endpoint calls the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthenticate</code> function. The JWT token received from
<strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/token</strong> is passed in the request body of
<strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/authenticate</strong>, and if the JWT is valid the endpoint returns
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>. Otherwise, it returns <code className="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>.
The SaintsXCTF API handles the response from <strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/authenticate</strong> by proceeding
with the user's request if the response is <code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>. Otherwise, it returns an HTTP
403 Forbidden error code.
</li>
<li>
When requests are made to the <strong>https://fn.saintsxctf.com</strong> API Gateway REST API which require
authorization, they use the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFAuthorizer</code> as a lambda authorizer.
The JWT token received from <strong>https://auth.saintsxctf.com/token</strong> is passed in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">Authorization</code> request header to <strong>https://fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>.
If the authorizer function determines that the JWT is valid, it gives the API Gateway endpoint permission to call its
corresponding AWS Lambda function.  If the JWT is invalid, invoking the AWS Lambda function is forbidden.
</li>
<li>
The JWT tokens created by the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFToken</code> AWS Lambda function are
signed using an RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) algorithm<sup>1</sup>. To perform this signing, a public key and private key
are stored in AWS SecretsManager. For additional security, these public and private keys are rotated on a regular
basis with the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">SaintsXCTFRotate</code> AWS Lambda function. This limits the
damage if an unwanted user gains access to the public and private keys, since their ability to sign tokens only
lasts until the next rotation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In a future article I will discuss all the authentication functions in more detail and step through their code.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Function REST API">Function REST API</SectionTitle>
<p>
The SaintsXCTF application has another REST API created with API Gateway and AWS Lambda called the "Function REST API".
This API is accessible from <strong>https://fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>. It includes endpoints for sending emails and
uploading pictures.  The AWS Lambda functions used by the REST API endpoints are written in Python and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The Terraform module for the function API exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-fn">saints-xctf-com-fn</a>
directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a>
repository.  The function API also has a separate
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-functions">saints-xctf-functions</a> repository for the AWS Lambda
function source code.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-com-fn.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
As with the authentication API, a future article will be dedicated to the function API.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="MySQL RDS Database">MySQL RDS Database</SectionTitle>
<p>
One main piece of infrastructure that didn't change in SaintsXCTF version 2.0 is the RDS MySQL database.  This
database holds all the persistent data used by the application, such as user information and exercise logs.
</p>
<p>
The Terraform module for the RDS MySQL database exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/database">database</a>
directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a>
repository.  I also have a private repository which holds SQL scripts for database deployments.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-database.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
At a high level, the <strong>database</strong> module contains a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/database/modules/rds/main.tf">main.tf</a>
file with the following resources.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="HCL">
resource "aws_security_group" "saints-xctf-database-security" {...}

resource "aws_db_instance" "saints-xctf-mysql-database" {...}

resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "saints-xctf-mysql-database-subnet" {...}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "saints-xctf-mysql-database-storage-low-alarm" {...}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_db_instance</code> is the main AWS resource that creates the RDS MySQL
database.  <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_security_group</code> provides other subnets in the SaintsXCTF
VPC access to make connections to the database, while <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_db_subnet_group</code>
specifies two subnets that the database exists within.  Since both subnets are housed in different AWS AZs
(Availability Zones), this configuration makes the database highly available. High availability provides protection
 in case one Availability Zone goes down. Finally, the
 <code className="jarombek-inline-code">aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm</code> resource creates a CloudWatch
alarm in case the RDS instance runs low on storage.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
In many ways, an application is only as good as the foundation it is built upon.  The AWS infrastructure for SaintsXCTF
keeps the application running with little downtime, which is key for a good user experience.  It is also
 modularized, allowing me to easily add new modules and drop old ones. This enables future application updates to
be smaller in scope than version 2.0, which completely rewrote the entire codebase.
</p>
<p>
In my <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/oct-25-2021-saints-xctf-v2-k8s-infrastructure">next SaintsXCTF article</a> I'll
discuss the other crucial piece of infrastructure for the application: Kubernetes on EKS.  All the AWS infrastructure
code for SaintsXCTF can be found on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">GitHub</a>.

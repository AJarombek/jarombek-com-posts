This is part of a series of articles on SaintsXCTF Version 2.0. The first article in the series provides an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">overview of the application</a>.
</Note>
<p>
The infrastructure for my website <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a> is hosted on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a>.  SaintsXCTF
had AWS infrastructure prior to version 2.0, but it was redesigned and rewritten for the new version.  This article
outlines the infrastructure and walks through <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Terraform&page=1">Terraform</a>
code which configures and builds the infrastructure.

SaintsXCTF application infrastructure can be grouped into two categories - AWS and Kubernetes.  This article only
discusses the AWS infrastructure, which has a green background in the diagram below.  The Kubernetes infrastructure,
which has a red background in the diagram, is discussed in the next article.
</p>

<p>
In Terraform code, the SaintsXCTF AWS infrastructure is logically grouped into modules.  These modules include (but are
not limited to) a load balancer to the Kubernetes infrastructure, an application asset S3 bucket, a user asset S3
bucket, an authentication REST API, an AWS Lambda function REST API, and a MySQL RDS database.  The other Terraform
modules in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">SaintsXCTF infrastructure repository</a>
perform smaller tasks such as debugging, database backups, and configuring SSL/TLS certificates.  These are not
discussed in this article.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Development and Production Infrastructure">Development and Production Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
While designing the SaintsXCTF version 2.0 infrastructure, I put a major emphasis on creating separate production and
development environments.  Since the initial website version was live during development of version 2.0, I needed a
separate non-production configuration to test.  Besides for the domain names and AWS resource names, the infrastructure
between the production and development environments was designed to be identical.  This allowed for predictable behavior
when building the production environment once the development environment was fully tested.  I plan to continue using
the development environment for testing new infrastructure changes going forward.
</p>
<p>
Under normal circumstances, the development environment isnâ€™t running in order to save money.  However, setting it up
only requires some <code className="jarombek-inline-code">terraform apply</code> commands invoked from
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/global-jenkins-jobs/tree/master/saints-xctf/infrastructure">Jenkins jobs</a>.
When running, the web application, main API, authentication API, and function API are accessible from
<strong>dev.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>dev.api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>dev.auth.saintsxctf.com</strong>,
and <strong>dev.fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>.  Their respective production equivalents are accessible from
<strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>auth.saintsxctf.com</strong>, and
<strong>fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>.
</p>
<p>
As previously mentioned, the SaintsXCTF AWS Terraform infrastructure is logically grouped into modules.  All these
modules are directories at the top level of the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  Many of
these modules are configured differently for the development and production environments.  For example, the
authentication API module has the following directory structure.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-terraform-module.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
There are three environmental configurations in this module - one for resources shared across all environments, one
for production, and one for development.  These environmental configurations invoke the submodules, which in the case
of the authentication API are <code className="jarombek-inline-code">api-gateway</code>,
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">lambda</code>, and <code className="jarombek-inline-code">secrets-manager</code>.
For example, inside <strong>saints-xctf-com-auth/env/prod</strong> is a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-auth/env/prod/main.tf">main.tf</a>
file which provisions the production infrastructure through the submodules.

<CodeSnippet language="HCL">

  region = "us-east-1"

  source = "../../modules/api-gateway"
  prod = true

  authenticate-lambda-invoke-arn = module.lambda.authenticate-function-invoke-arn
  token-lambda-name = module.lambda.token-function-name
  token-lambda-invoke-arn = module.lambda.token-function-invoke-arn
}

module "secrets-manager" {
  source = "../../modules/secrets-manager"
  prod = true

  rotation-lambda-arn = module.lambda.rotate-function-arn

  secret_rotation_depends_on = [
    module.lambda.rotate-function-arn,
    module.lambda.rotate-secrets-manager-permission-id,
    module.lambda.rotate-log-group-id
  ]
}
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
The Terraform submodules are invoked with certain input variables, including a
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">prod</code> flag.  This variable determines whether the infrastructure needs to
be built in the production environment (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">true</code>) or the development
environment (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">false</code>). Most of the modules I talk about in the upcoming
segments follow this environment/submodule pattern.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Load Balancer to EKS">Load Balancer to EKS</SectionTitle>
<p>
The Terraform module which creates an AWS Application Load Balancer to route traffic to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=aws%20eks&page=1">AWS EKS</a> is unique compared to the other modules
discussed in this article.  Instead of using the AWS Terraform provider to build the infrastructure, the load balancer
is created by the Kubernetes Terraform provider.  Specifically, the EKS cluster has an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-28-2020-eks#alb-ingress-controller-and-external-dns">ALB Ingress Controller</a>
(now known as an <a href="https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/">AWS Load Balancer
Controller</a>) running in a pod.  This ingress controller is capable of building load balancers that route traffic to
Kubernetes services. Using the Kubernetes Terraform provider, an <code className="jarombek-inline-code">Ingress</code>
object is created with certain annotations, resulting in the ingress controller provisioning load balancer
infrastructure in AWS.
</p>
<p>
In the context of SaintsXCTF, both the web application and main API are hosted on Kubernetes.  The load balancer
created by the ingress controller routes traffic to Kubernetes for both the <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong> and
<strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong> domains.  The Terraform module for the load balancer and Kubernetes Ingress object
exists in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-ingress">
saints-xctf-com-ingress</a> directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">
saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  I will provide more details about this code in my upcoming article on
SaintsXCTF Kubernetes infrastructure.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Application Asset S3 Bucket">Application Asset S3 Bucket</SectionTitle>
<p>
SaintsXCTF contains images and videos which are hosted in an S3 bucket behind a CloudFront distribution. I refer to
this bucket as the "application asset S3 bucket", and it is accessible from <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>.  I
wrote an <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/feb-15-2020-s3-react">article</a> about hosting static websites on S3 and
CloudFront, and the concept is similar for <strong>asset.saintsxctf.com</strong>. S3 holds the images and videos as
objects, and the CloudFront CDN speeds up the retrieval of these assets.
</p>

<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-18-21-saints-xctf-com-asset.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The Terraform module for the application asset S3 bucket exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-asset">
saints-xctf-com-asset</a> directory in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">
saints-xctf-infrastructure</a> repository.  In this module there is just one production environment configuration.
There is no separate development configuration since the assets are the same for both development and production
environments.  Also, during development, there is no harm in adding additional assets that aren't yet accessible on
the production website.

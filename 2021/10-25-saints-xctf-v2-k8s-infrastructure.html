SaintsXCTF application infrastructure can be grouped into two categories - AWS and Kubernetes.  This article only
discusses the Kubernetes infrastructure, which has a green background in the diagram below.  The AWS infrastructure,
which has a red background in the diagram, was discussed in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
jun-18-2021-saints-xctf-v2-aws-infrastructure">a prior article</a>.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Similar to the AWS infrastructure, the SaintsXCTF Kubernetes infrastructure is logically grouped into Terraform
modules.  More specifically, there are three Terraform modules for Kubernetes infrastructure.  The
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com">first</a> is for the web
 (frontend) application, the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/saints-xctf-com-api">
second</a> is for the API (backend) application, and the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/
master/saints-xctf-com-ingress">third</a> is for an Ingress object which directs traffic to the web application and
API.  All three are discussed in this article.

<p>
In the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview#lift-and-shift-aws-architecture">prior
infrastructure for my SaintsXCTF website</a>, the web application and API were hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS.  While
this worked okay, it presented a number of issues.  First, there was no easy way to update the application without any
downtime.  Second, since the application was on a virtual machine and not a container, updates to the virtual machine
often caused unexpected behavior for the application, sometimes requiring code changes.
</p>
<p>
While updating the application infrastructure for version 2.0, I wanted to use a more lightweight container approach to my application
infrastructure.  I also wanted to leverage a container orchestrator with built-in deployment management that could
 update an application with zero downtime.  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Docker&page=1">Docker</a>
containers orchestrated with Kubernetes matched this requirement.  Since my application was already hosted on AWS,
the clear choice was to use <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=aws%20eks&page=1">AWS EKS</a> to host
 Kubernetes infrastructure for the application.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="SaintsXCTF Web Application Infrastructure">SaintsXCTF Web Application Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
Kubernetes infrastructure for the web application consists of a service and a deployment.  The service networks traffic to
the pods in the deployment.  The service YAML configuration is shown below.
</p>
<CodeSnippet language="YAML">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: saints-xctf-web-service
  namespace: saints-xctf
  labels:

  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    application: saints-xctf-web
</CodeSnippet>
<p>
This YAML configuration is translated into HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) for use in Terraform.  The
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com/modules/kubernetes/
main.tf#L137-L162">Terraform configuration for the service</a> is shown below.

<p>
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">saints-xctf-web-deployment</code> object creates two pods which host the
SaintsXCTF web application (as configured by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">replicas</code>).  The deployment
strategy is a <code className="jarombek-inline-code">RollingUpdate</code>, which allows for zero downtime as pods
update one by one.  The pods are configured with node affinity (configured by <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
node_affinity</code>), which forces all pods to exist on Kubernetes cluster nodes with a certain label, in this case
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">production-applications</code>.  Node affinity allows me to separate production
applications from non-production and prototype applications on my Kubernetes cluster.  The pods are configured with
readiness probes (<code className="jarombek-inline-code">readiness_probe</code>) and liveness probes
(<code className="jarombek-inline-code">liveness_probe</code>).  The readiness probe checks that the web application is
accessible via HTTP requests, and the liveness probe checks that the API is accessible from the pod via HTTP requests.
If these checks fail, a new pod is started and the current pod is terminated.  This helps ensure that my application
doesn't face any downtime.

<SectionTitle title="SaintsXCTF API Infrastructure">SaintsXCTF API Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
Similar to the web application infrastructure, the API infrastructure consists of Kubernetes service and deployment
objects.  Unlike the web application, the API has two services and two deployments.  One service-deployment pair is for
an Nginx reverse proxy, and the other is for a uWSGI application server.  The Nginx reverse
proxy sits in front of the uWSGI server, routing traffic to it.  The uWSGI application server holds the API code.  I wrote
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-24-2021-nginx-docker">an article</a> about using Nginx reverse proxies, with the
SaintsXCTF application as the case study.
</p>
<p>
Just like the web application Kubernetes configuration, the API Kubernetes configuration has YAML documents for the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-api/modules/kubernetes/
k8s-config/service.yaml">services</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/
saints-xctf-com-api/modules/kubernetes/k8s-config/deployment.yaml">deployments</a> which are translated into
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-api/modules/kubernetes/
main.tf">Terraform configuration</a>.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Ingress Infrastructure">Ingress Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
<p>
The SaintsXCTF Kubernetes infrastructure has an Ingress object, which creates load balancing infrastructure needed
to route traffic from the internet to the web application and API.  The Ingress object utilizes an ALB Ingress
Controller (now known as an AWS Load Balancer Controller) to create a load balancer on AWS for the SaintsXCTF
application.  It also uses ExternalDNS to create Route53 DNS records for <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>,
<strong>www.saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>, and <strong>www.api.saintsxctf.com</strong>.
I discussed ALB Ingress Controllers and  ExternalDNS in another article on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
sep-28-2020-eks">AWS EKS</a>.
</p>
<p>
Again, the infrastructure is originally configured in YAML and then translated into Terraform/HCL.  The following code
is the Ingress YAML configuration.  The Terraform configuration is viewable on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
saints-xctf-infrastructure/blob/master/saints-xctf-com-ingress/modules/kubernetes/main.tf">GitHub</a>.

<p>
Four hosts are specified in the configuration - <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong>, <strong>api.saintsxctf.com</strong>,
and their <strong>www</strong> prefixed equivalents.  Traffic to these domains are appropriately routed to either the SaintsXCTF web
application or API via their Kubernetes services.  The most interesting configuration fields are found in the
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">annotations</code> dictionary.  All the <code className="jarombek-inline-code">
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io</code> annotations configure an AWS load balancer to route traffic to the Kubernetes cluster.
The <code className="jarombek-inline-code">external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io</code> annotation creates Route53 DNS
records for my SaintsXCTF web application & API domains.  With these DNS records created, HTTP/HTTPS requests to the
 four <strong>saintsxctf.com</strong> domains are routed to the AWS load balancer created by the Ingress object, which
 in turn routes traffic to my Kubernetes Pods.
</p>
<p>
With the Ingress object and Service/Deployment objects created in Kubernetes, the website and API are fully functional
and accessible from clients browsing the internet!
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
Maintaining my SaintsXCTF web application and API infrastructure on Kubernetes is a massive improvement over my
previous AWS EC2 virtual machine setup.  With Kubernetes, I can easily release new versions of my website and API with
zero downtime.  Terraform also improves my ability to quickly alter Kubernetes infrastructure, since all the
infrastructure is configured as code and can be created, updated, or destroyed on demand.  All the code for my
Kubernetes infrastructure is available on <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">GitHub</a>.
I also have <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure/tree/master/test-k8s">test code</a> for my
Kubernetes infrastructure, which is discussed further in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/
oct-10-2021-kubernetes-tests-go">another article</a>.

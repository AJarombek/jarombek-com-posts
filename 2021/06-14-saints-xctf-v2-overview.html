On December 24th 2016, I released my first website <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a>.  I was still a
senior in college at the time, and used my limited software development knowledge from classes and a summer internship
to build the application.  SaintsXCTF is a running training log designed for my college Cross Country and Track & Field
teams at St. Lawrence University.  Competitively running in college had a major impact on my life, and I was really
proud to create the website to assist my teammates and coaches.  Shortly after releasing the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf">website</a>, I created an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-android">Android application</a> and an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios">iOS application</a> for SaintsXCTF.  With SaintsXCTF accessible
via web browsers and mobile applications, I felt my development work was complete and moved on to other programming
projects.

<p>
As I began my professional software engineering career in the summer of 2017, I gradually learned industry best
practices and became more well rounded as a developer.  At this point, certain shortcomings and misguided assumptions
about my SaintsXCTF applications became apparent.  First, the core web application and API did not follow the latest
industry standards.  Second, all three applications were not properly tested and were prone to degradation when left
unchecked.  Third, the security & infrastructure of the application was very basic and not fault tolerant. Lastly, my
assumption that releasing the applications meant my work was done proved to be incorrect. As all software engineers
know, the work is only just beginning when an application is initially released.
</p>
<p>
These realizations resulted in a multi-year effort to create a new version of SaintsXCTF which checked off all the boxes
that the original missed.  I decided upon a two step process to get the original version of SaintsXCTF converted to a
new version.  The first step began in December 2018 and was completed in February 2019.  This step moved the website,
API, and database infrastructure to AWS.  All the infrastructure was written as code using Terraform.  The second step
began in June 2019 and was completed in May 2021.  This two year development step rewrote the SaintsXCTF application.

This article explores the architectural changes to the SaintsXCTF application across these iterations.  Subsequent
articles discuss certain components, technologies, and design decisions in SaintsXCTF 2.0.

On December 24th 2016, I released my first website <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a>.  I was still a
senior in college at the time, and used my limited software development knowledge from classes and a summer internship
to build the application.  SaintsXCTF is a training log designed for my college Cross Country and Track & Field
teams at St. Lawrence University.  Running competitively in college had a major impact on my life, and I was really
proud to create the website to assist my teammates and coaches.  Shortly after releasing the
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf">website</a>, I created an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-android">Android application</a> and an
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios">iOS application</a> for SaintsXCTF.  With SaintsXCTF accessible
via web browsers and mobile applications, I felt my development work was complete and moved on to other programming
projects.
</p>
<p>
As I began my professional software engineering career in the summer of 2017, I gradually learned industry best
practices and became more well rounded as a developer.  At this point, certain shortcomings and misguided assumptions
about my SaintsXCTF applications became apparent.  First, the core web application and API did not follow the latest
industry standards.  Second, all three applications were not properly tested and were prone to degradation if left
unchecked.  Third, the security & infrastructure of the applications was very basic and not fault tolerant. Lastly, my
assumption that releasing the applications meant my work was done proved to be incorrect. As all software engineers
know, the work just begins when an application is initially released.
</p>
<p>
These realizations resulted in a multi-year effort to create a new version of SaintsXCTF that fixed all the issues with
 the original.  I decided upon a two step process to get the original version of SaintsXCTF converted to the
 new version.  The first step began in December 2018 and was completed in February 2019.  This step moved the website,
API, and database infrastructure to AWS.  All the infrastructure was written as code using Terraform.  The second step
began in June 2019 and was completed in May 2021.  This two year development step rewrote the SaintsXCTF
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">web application</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-api">API</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-infrastructure">infrastructure</a>.  It also created a new
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-auth">authentication API</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-functions">AWS Lambda Function API</a>.
</p>
<p>
This article explores the architectural changes to the SaintsXCTF application across these iterations.  Subsequent
articles discuss certain components, technologies, and design decisions in SaintsXCTF 2.0.

<SectionTitle title="Initial Architecture">Initial Architecture</SectionTitle>
<p>
The initial SaintsXCTF infrastructure was extremely barebones, consisting of a single hosted linux server. This
server, a virtual machine hosted by Linode, ran the web application, API, and database.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-14-21-initial-architecture.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
There are many flaws with this architecture design.  The most obvious issue is that the linux server is a single point
of failure.  If the server goes down, so does the website, API, and database.  Worst of all, in the case of a
catastrophic failure where the virtual machine’s file system isn’t recoverable, all the application data is lost.  For
an application with user information and exercise logs uploaded every day, this is an unacceptable level of risk.
</p>
<p>
The initial UI and API code was tightly coupled into a single codebase. The API was written in
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=PHP&page=1">PHP</a> without the use of any server framework. The UI code was
written in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=JavaScript&page=1">JavaScript</a> using the JQuery library.
</p>
<p>
These technologies have their fair share of issues as well.  In the UI technology ecosystem, JQuery is infamous for
resulting in difficult to read spaghetti code.  With modern front-end frameworks and libraries such as React and
Angular, UI code has become more modular, clean, and reusable.  In college, I wasn't aware of these libraries, so
JQuery was a logical starting point.  An additional problem with the UI code was the stylesheet.  The UI consisted of
one single CSS file for the entire application.  This resulted in hard to identify styling issues, especially when
adding new styles to one page negatively impacted another page.  Once again, modern CSS preprocessors and CSS in
JavaScript libraries have greatly improved the modularity of stylesheets as modern frameworks and libraries have for
JavaScript code.
</p>
<p>
In the API technology ecosystem, the lack of a server-side framework resulted in hard to read code.  Also, certain
actions such as creating classes that represent HTTP request objects were written by me.  If I used a back-end
framework instead, these classes would have been provided for me.  I was reinventing the wheel without realizing it.  Another issue
with the API was that it shared the same codebase and build process (a manual SFTP upload to the linux server) as the
front-end code.  This meant if the website went down, the API would as well.  If new UI code was deployed, the API was
redeployed as well.  In the second version of the application, I redesigned the codebase to separate the UI and API.
</p>
<p>
Due to all these flaws in the initial website’s technology stack and infrastructure, I stopped
 enhancing the functionality of the application shortly after releasing it.  Instead, I began planning an iterative process of refurbishing the
application up to industry standards.
</p>
<SectionTitle title="Lift and Shift AWS Architecture">Lift and Shift AWS Architecture</SectionTitle>
<p>
Before creating entirely new codebases for the UI and API, I fixed all the fatal flaws with the initial
version of the application.  The biggest flaw of the initial design was the linux server, which was a single point of
failure.  If that server went down, everything would have been lost.
</p>
<p>
To remedy this issue I redesigned the infrastructure on <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS&page=1">AWS</a>
and wrote the infrastructure as code using <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Terraform&page=1">Terraform</a>.  As a result, I
 was able to build the infrastructure in a repeatable manner.  This new infrastructure was designed without any single points of
failure.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-14-21-aws-lift-shift-architecture.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
From the end user perspective, nothing changed while using the application after these changes.  However, the
reliability of the application greatly increased.  First, in a worst case scenario where the infrastructure broke,
Terraform scripts were capable of recreating the infrastructure in a matter of minutes.
</p>
<p>
Second, I implemented an AWS Lambda function (not shown in the infrastructure diagram) which takes
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/sep-3-2019-rds-backups-pt1">database backups</a> daily and uploads them to S3.
Therefore, the new worst case scenario would result in one day of lost data; a great improvement over losing everything.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, this scenario is extremely unlikely.  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=aws%20rds&page=1">AWS RDS</a>
(the MySQL database) and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=aws%20ec2&page=1">AWS EC2</a> (the API and web application
server) have impressive uptime percentages of 99.95% and 99.99%, respectively<sup>1,2</sup>.  RDS also takes snapshots
on a regular basis for disaster recovery purposes.  With this impressive reliability, I never had to use my database
backup files to restore the database.  Nevertheless, the peace of mind it gave me was worth it.
</p>

<p>
With the application infrastructure in a reliable state, I took my time creating a second version of the web
application and API.  With increased knowledge of cloud infrastructure, containers, and container orchestrators, I
also decided to rewrite the application infrastructure for a third time.  I released this new codebase at the end of
May 2021.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/6-14-21-v2-architecture.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
The updated infrastructure for the new version of the application is still hosted on AWS and written as code with
Terraform.  The biggest infrastructure change was moving to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Kubernetes&page=1">Kubernetes</a> on
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=EKS&page=1">EKS</a>.  Both the API and web application are
deployed on Kubernetes pods, with traffic routed to them from an AWS load balancer.  All the Kubernetes infrastructure is
created with Terraform as well.  With the combined ease of Terraform and elegance of Kubernetes deployments, updating
or reverting a website or API version is as easy as building
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Docker&page=1">Docker</a> images and applying Terraform changes.  I go
into all the technical details of this process in the article on SaintsXCTF Kubernetes Infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Other infrastructure changes include the use of <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=API%20Gateway&page=1">API Gateway</a>
and <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS%20Lambda&page=1">AWS Lambda</a>.  There are two APIs deployed on API
Gateway - an authentication API (<strong>auth.saintsxctf.com</strong>) and a function API
(<strong>fn.saintsxctf.com</strong>).  The authentication API has endpoints for creating authentication tokens and
validating authentication tokens.  These tokens are <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=JWT&page=1">JWTs</a> that
have a lifespan of one hour.  This authentication approach is a major improvement over my old implementation, which
just used a static passcode in the authorization header for all API calls.
</p>
<p>
The function API serves many purposes, including profile picture uploads and all the email functionality on the
website.  Profile pictures are saved and accessed from an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=AWS%20S3&page=1">AWS S3</a> bucket.
</p>
<p>
The API and web application technology stacks where built from the ground up for the new version.  The API now uses the
Flask server side library, which is written in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=Python&page=1">Python</a>.  The
web application uses <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=React&page=1">React</a>, Redux, and
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=JSS&page=1">JSS</a>.  This time
around all the front-end code is written in <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=TypeScript&page=1">TypeScript</a>
instead of <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=JavaScript&page=1">JavaScript</a>.  The only unchanged technology between
the two versions of the application is the MySQL database, which is hosted on AWS RDS.  All these technologies and
their use in SaintsXCTF are discussed in depth in separate articles.

<SectionTitle title="Conclusions">Conclusions</SectionTitle>
<p>
SaintsXCTF has undergone massive changes since its initial release in December 2016.  My knowledge of the software
engineering landscape has grown a lot since my senior year of college, and that growth is displayed in the
technological changes of SaintsXCTF.  Learning from and evolving this application is invaluable to my growth as a
software engineer, and I’m excited for its continued evolution in the future.

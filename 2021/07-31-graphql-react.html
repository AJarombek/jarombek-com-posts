Last year, I started using <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=graphql&page=1">GraphQL</a> at my job.  I decided to
create some GraphQL prototypes in my spare time, to get better acquainted with the GraphQL ecosystem.  In 2018 I learned
the basics of GraphQL and wrote <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-5-2018-graphql-pt1">two</a>
 <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/aug-9-2018-graphql-pt2">articles</a> about my experience, but never dove into using
GraphQL in real world applications.  The <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/graphql-react-prototype">GraphQL React prototype</a>
discussed in this article along with my <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype">Apollo prototype</a>
are the beginnings of that production application journey.  In the future, I plan on using GraphQL for the API layer of
my applications.
</p>
<p>
The GraphQL prototype discussed in this article is a <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=react&page=1">React</a>
front-end application that connects to a GitHub GraphQL API.  The API provides details about my repositories, and React
displays those details in a dashboard.  The dashboard is shown below.

<p>
The dashboard has a responsive design, so its also viewable on tablets and mobile screens.

The React code for the dashboard is broken down into multiple components, with each box displayed on the screen being
its own component.  Components use Less for their stylesheet language.  Less, similar to
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=sass&page=1">Sass</a>, is a CSS preprocessor, which adds features on top of
the base CSS language.
</p>
<p>
Each component makes a GraphQL query to the GitHub API, collecting the data it wishes to display.  The front-end code
doesn’t use a GraphQL client library to make the API calls, instead just using an HTTP client library called
<code className="jarombek-inline-code">axios</code>.  In an upcoming article I’ll discuss my
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/apollo-client-server-prototype">Apollo prototype</a>, which uses the Apollo Client
library to make API calls. While the HTTP client library is a more bare-bones approach, it is still fully capable of
handling GraphQL APIs.

This is part of a series of articles on SaintsXCTF Version 2.0. The first article in the series provides an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">overview of the application</a>.
</Note>
<p>
At its core, SaintsXCTF is a web application that allows users to log their running workouts, openly express how they
felt while running, and encourage and support the running careers of their teammates.  From a user perspective, the
website is the most important part of the SaintsXCTF technology stack, as it is what they interact with every day and
depend on being functional.
</p>
<p>
When I wrote the first version of the <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a> website, I was a senior in
college who had just begun learning web development.  I was also new to UI design.  Over time this inexperience became
more and more apparent when viewing the first version of the website and its underlying code.  I knew when designing
the second version of the website, I not only needed to follow best engineering practices, but also make an elegant UI
design.
</p>
<p>
The next five articles in the SaintsXCTF series are devoted solely to the website and its React codebase.  This article
gives an overview of the technologies used in the frontend code and a walkthrough of the pages on the website.

Version 2.0 of the SaintsXCTF web application uses the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=react&page=1">React.js</a>
front-end library.  For stylesheets, it uses <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=jss&page=1">JSS</a> (CSS in
JavaScript).  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=redux&page=1">Redux</a> is leveraged for state management within
the React application.  For testing, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=jest&page=1">Jest</a> is utilized for
Unit, Integration, and Snapshot tests.  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=cypress&page=1">Cypress</a> is utilized
for End to End (E2E) tests.
</p>
<p>
When I first started creating version 2.0 of the web application, I was writing all the React, Redux, and JSS code in
JavaScript.  However, after further consideration, I decided to pivot towards writing all the frontend code in
TypeScript.  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static type checking and additional language features.
Nowadays, I often use TypeScript instead of JavaScript to make my code safer and less prone to subtle bugs.  With
SaintsXCTF, version 2.0 was a great opportunity to finally use TypeScript in a production application.  Alongside the
application code, the Jest and Cypress test code is also written in TypeScript.
</p>
<p>
The React application is bundled for distribution with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=webpack&page=1">
Webpack</a>.  Locally, the application can be run either using Webpack Dev Server or Docker.  In production, the
application runs on a Docker container.  The Docker container configures and runs an Nginx server, which routes
requests to the React code bundle.  This Docker container is orchestrated using Kubernetes and is part of a larger AWS
infrastructure.

Upcoming articles will look at the web application code in detail, but the codebase is also accessible on GitHub in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">saints-xctf-web</a> repository.

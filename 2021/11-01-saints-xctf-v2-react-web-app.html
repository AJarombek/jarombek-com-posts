This is part of a series of articles on SaintsXCTF Version 2.0. The first article in the series provides an
<a href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jun-14-2021-saints-xctf-v2-overview">overview of the application</a>.
</Note>
<p>
At its core, SaintsXCTF is a web application that allows users to log their running workouts, openly express how they
felt while running, and encourage and support the running careers of their teammates.  From a user perspective, the
website is the most important part of the SaintsXCTF technology stack, as it is what they interact with every day and
depend on being functional.
</p>
<p>
When I wrote the first version of the <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a> website, I was a senior in
college who had just begun learning web development.  I was also new to UI design.  Over time this inexperience became
more and more apparent when viewing the first version of the website and its underlying code.  I knew when designing
the second version of the website, I not only needed to follow best engineering practices, but also make an elegant UI
design.
</p>
<p>
The next five articles in the SaintsXCTF series are devoted solely to the website and its React codebase.  This article
gives an overview of the technologies used in the frontend code and a walkthrough of the pages on the website.

Version 2.0 of the SaintsXCTF web application uses the <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=react&page=1">React.js</a>
front-end library.  For stylesheets, it uses <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=jss&page=1">JSS</a> (CSS in
JavaScript).  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=redux&page=1">Redux</a> is leveraged for state management within
the React application.  For testing, <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=jest&page=1">Jest</a> is utilized for
Unit, Integration, and Snapshot tests.  <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=cypress&page=1">Cypress</a> is utilized
for End to End (E2E) tests.
</p>
<p>
When I first started creating version 2.0 of the web application, I was writing all the React, Redux, and JSS code in
JavaScript.  However, after further consideration, I decided to pivot towards writing all the frontend code in
TypeScript.  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static type checking and additional language features.
Nowadays, I often use TypeScript instead of JavaScript to make my code safer and less prone to subtle bugs.  With
SaintsXCTF, version 2.0 was a great opportunity to finally use TypeScript in a production application.  Alongside the
application code, the Jest and Cypress test code is also written in TypeScript.
</p>
<p>
The React application is bundled for distribution with <a href="https://jarombek.com/blog?query=webpack&page=1">
Webpack</a>.  Locally, the application can be run either using Webpack Dev Server or Docker.  In production, the
application runs on a Docker container.  The Docker container configures and runs an Nginx server, which routes
requests to the React code bundle.  This Docker container is orchestrated using Kubernetes and is part of a larger AWS
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming articles will look at the web application code in detail, but the codebase is also accessible on GitHub in a
<a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-web">saints-xctf-web</a> repository.

<SectionTitle title="Website Overview">Website Overview</SectionTitle>
<p>
There are two main sections of the <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">saintsxctf.com</a> website: when there is no user
session and when a user is signed in.  When there is no user session, the landing page is the home page:
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
When there is a user session, the landing page is the dashboard page:
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/11-1-21-saintsxctf-dashboard.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
User sessions are determined by a JWT in the browser’s <code className="jarombek-inline-code">localStorage</code>.  The
JWT token is passed along with all API requests for authentication.  If the JWT is expired or an API call results in an
unauthenticated error, the JWT is removed and the user is signed out.
</p>
<p>
A signed out user has the option to sign in or register.  Both sign in and registration have their own pages.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
As shown previously, signed in users are navigated to a dashboard page, which shows the latest exercise logs uploaded
by the team.  It also gives them multiple navigation options.  Since the main purpose of the website is to allow users
to write exercise logs, there is a page with an exercise log form.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Each user has a profile page.  Profile pages consist of multiple tabs, each of which shows a different view to the
user.  Tabs include exercise logs, statistics, a weekly chart, and a monthly calendar.
</p>

<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/11-1-21-saintsxctf-profile-stats.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
If the profile page corresponds to the signed in user, an additional administrative tab is viewable, allowing the user
to edit their profile.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/11-1-21-saintsxctf-profile-edit.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
Each user is a member of zero to many teams, and each team consists of one or many groups.  These groups also get their
own pages with multiple tabs.  One way to navigate to a group page is by clicking on the <strong>Teams</strong> link in
the navigation bar, which displays all the teams the user is a member of and all the corresponding groups.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/11-1-21-saintsxctf-teams.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
From here, a group page can be accessed.  For example, the following screenshots show all the tabs on the
<strong>Admin</strong> group page within the team <strong>St. Lawrence Cross Country and Track & Field</strong>.

</figure>
<p>
The website also has an admin feature, where certain users are designated as administrators for specific groups.  If a
user is an administrator, they can access a separate section of the website.  The admin section starts with a page that
lists all the groups for which the user is an administrator.
</p>
<figure>
<img className="jarombek-blog-image" src="https://asset.jarombek.com/posts/11-1-21-saintsxctf-admin.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
From this page, group admin pages are selectable.  Group admin pages have multiple tabs, giving users different ways to
alter the groups, change memberships, and invite new users to the website.

I’m really proud to see all my hard work pay off with the new version of the <a href="https://saintsxctf.com/">
saintsxctf.com</a> website.  In the next couple articles, I’ll look at the technical details of the website in more
detail.  If you want a preview of the code, you can view the website code in the <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/
